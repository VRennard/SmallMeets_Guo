Good morning . <vocalsound> So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . So people can <gap> can use it without any any problem . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Mm . B did you send us an email about this ? <vocalsound> but if you want <disfmarker> Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . <vocalsound> Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or you can put it in the shared folder . Yeah , I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . <gap> . You get email , <gap> . <vocalsound> I dunno from who . <vocalsound> Yeah , from the account manager . <vocalsound> From the account manager . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's for your guys to <vocalsound> how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . Yeah . Yeah , I think so . Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . Yeah <vocalsound> I think <gap> assign your uh roles . In each <disfmarker> We already have our role . For each for each one . So there are <disfmarker> so we have three <disfmarker> So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . Okay , alright . <vocalsound> So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? <vocalsound> Any any volunteer ? I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we <disfmarker> in our mail we received from the account manager . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah .
<vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Uh I'm doing the interface . You are doing th No , I'm doing the interface . <vocalsound> <gap> . Well , maybe we have <disfmarker> okay so I <gap> industrial design . It was a little confusion about my uh <disfmarker> Ah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but it's alright . Okay . Okay , I'll for industrial design . Yeah . Okay . And and you <disfmarker> Norman ? Mm ? Um working on i . <vocalsound> User interface . <vocalsound> User . And <disfmarker> And <disfmarker> Uh , I'm into marketing . <gap> doing the marketing . Nothing related here to the <disfmarker> Marketing in this design . A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . Yes . Yeah , this is <gap> . See there's a role for everybody . Yeah , that's right ,
that's your role . I <gap> . Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> About the design or <disfmarker> Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . Mm-hmm . how we can make it work <vocalsound> . Yes . I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes <disfmarker> remote controls . <vocalsound> Yeah , I dunno I <disfmarker> What we we have to keep in mind the <disfmarker> these characteristics . And of course it should not be very costly . Yeah , that's right . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or Need to collect information . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I'm part of design , perhaps . Uh , what is most important in a <disfmarker> in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ? Uh . <vocalsound> That's alright . <vocalsound> That's the <vocalsound> that's the big thing . Yeah , it should be easy to work with . <vocalsound>
We can think about an interface with uh well <disfmarker> Uh . We <disfmarker> maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want <disfmarker> which channel . Or or you can say for example , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I want uh to list all the programme tonight . You won't <disfmarker> Y you know <gap> , instead of <gap> uh remote control it's doing the <disfmarker> some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press <disfmarker> I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . Or a button for all the magazines , all the information <disfmarker> documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . No , Th this information exists . For example you can get um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . You can use uh <disfmarker> well for example <disfmarker> anything . <vocalsound> The <vocalsound> the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . I <disfmarker> I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . In the hand . Yeah . Yeah . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with <gap> trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog Yeah . Yes , possible . if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah . And I could talk to the T_V_ <disfmarker> television itself . Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um <vocalsound> there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . On the content . Mm-hmm , yeah . Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea So it's more powerful . Mm-hmm . but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to <disfmarker> Yeah . No . No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are <disfmarker> they are <disfmarker> they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , Yeah yeah . so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the <disfmarker> to this remote control . And then there's <disfmarker> there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . Mm . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so <vocalsound> you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the <disfmarker> Well channel programme or contents or <disfmarker> in an easy way , so <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . So <gap> . Yeah . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen Good idea <vocalsound> . and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Okay . Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah , yeah . So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Okay . And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh <vocalsound> some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . Yeah . Yeah . S The lighting in the room changes . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . You <disfmarker> it <gap> . I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . Okay . Oh right so <disfmarker> Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? Yeah . Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ? Okay . Uh , uh first one is to uh <vocalsound> buttons i or it could be anything with <gap> buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels . Okay . Choose by contents or by channels . And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . Mm . Okay , so technically how <disfmarker> the problems that <disfmarker> how to do it is to <disfmarker> how to get the content . <vocalsound> Yeah . Challenge . I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so <disfmarker>
So this one of the problem . And uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think that's the <gap> the things to do The main thing . and uh to uh reflect about it Okay . Alright . and uh discuss it in the next meeting . Alright , okay . So we are <disfmarker> we'll discuss it <disfmarker> we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer <gap> ? That's the first aspect . Right . We will <gap> get information and then we'll come back in . Yeah , we'll come . So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects . Alright .
and uh discuss it in the next meeting . Alright , okay . That's the first aspect . Right . We will <gap> get information and then we'll come back in . Okay . So this one of the problem . And uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think that's the <gap> the things to do The main thing . and uh to uh reflect about it Okay . Alright .
On the content . Mm-hmm , yeah . Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea So it's more powerful . Okay . Uh , uh first one is to uh <vocalsound> buttons i or it could be anything with <gap> buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels . Okay . Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um <vocalsound> there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .
Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Mm . B did you send us an email about this ? <vocalsound> but if you want <disfmarker> Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . <vocalsound> Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or you can put it in the shared folder . Yeah , I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . <gap> . You get email , <gap> . <vocalsound> I dunno from who . <vocalsound> Yeah , from the account manager . <vocalsound> From the account manager . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . Okay , alright . <vocalsound> So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? <vocalsound> Any any volunteer ? I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we <disfmarker> in our mail we received from the account manager . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Uh I'm doing the interface . You are doing th No , I'm doing the interface . <vocalsound> <gap> . Well , maybe we have <disfmarker> okay so I <gap> industrial design . It was a little confusion about my uh <disfmarker> Ah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but it's alright . Okay . Okay , I'll for industrial design . Yeah . Okay . And and you <disfmarker> Norman ? Mm ? Yeah , this is <gap> . See there's a role for everybody . Yeah , that's right ,
We can think about an interface with uh well <disfmarker> Uh . We <disfmarker> maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want <disfmarker> which channel . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . No , Th this information exists . For example you can get um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . You can use uh <disfmarker> well for example <disfmarker> anything . <vocalsound> The <vocalsound> the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . I <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with <gap> trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog Yeah . Yes , possible . if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah . And I could talk to the T_V_ <disfmarker> television itself . Except if if you are far from the T_V_ .
So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so <disfmarker> Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . Mm , okay . So I handle to <disfmarker> I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . So shall I go to Thanks . Alright , so from <disfmarker> when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up <disfmarker> volume up , down <disfmarker> volume down . The green are the channel changing . <vocalsound> S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um <disfmarker> Yeah . I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the <disfmarker> under the flip . Yes , okay . No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . Yes . But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . <vocalsound> Uh it's it's <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . I don't wanna say . Louder . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . Can also be on the side . Yeah , the sides maybe is good . Yeah . It's um <disfmarker> It's um <disfmarker> Compliments to the artist . You need to work on the weight a little bit . <vocalsound> Yes . Okay . S <vocalsound> I'm fine , I'm satisfi And maybe the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but <disfmarker> I'm satisfied . <vocalsound> We're glad you're satisfied . There's only so much you can do . Yes . We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . Mm-hmm . So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something . Yep . <vocalsound> So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually . That's your uh prototype model ? Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . Okay . Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , that uh <disfmarker>
Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . <vocalsound> Um , so <vocalsound> to unveil our lovely product . <vocalsound> This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> Um , this is actually hard to do . So up <disfmarker> volume up , down <disfmarker> volume down . The green are the channel changing . <vocalsound> S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , <vocalsound> Oh yes . Yeah the d Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .
<gap> So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . So here you can uh look like uh the energy <gap> and uh <gap> dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that . <vocalsound> So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's uh <disfmarker> actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh <disfmarker> below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . <vocalsound> Than thank you . Well we haven't come to mine yet , so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , okay we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . <vocalsound> . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? <vocalsound> So maybe it's <disfmarker> for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a <vocalsound> o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , No we do , but it's not filled in . it's gonna be <disfmarker> It's not . Thirty . We don't have the price up there , Yeah . Yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah , you're right , sorry , yes . Yeah . Yeah . okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . So that means we can put the uh <disfmarker> the L_C_D_ in , yeah . Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh <vocalsound> the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that <gap> has to be taken in into consideration . <vocalsound> Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh <disfmarker> Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro . <vocalsound> And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh <disfmarker> the cost of the unit for the company . Yes . Yes . Yep . Um-hmm . So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . Yes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , <vocalsound> Yes . so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . <vocalsound> Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on <disfmarker> on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh Slightly . Yeah . It's gonna be very hard to reduce . Yes . the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh <vocalsound> be fixed at the <disfmarker> Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . That's not bad . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . If we can go to to my display .
Although <vocalsound> since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it <disfmarker> this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . we'll look at the findings . Next screen . <vocalsound> Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , Mm-hmm . which is actually a tremendous amount . <vocalsound> Yeah , no kidding . <vocalsound> Mayb maybe they already expected something . So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , Yes . with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav <gap> gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . Um-hmm . Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . Mm-hmm . Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the <disfmarker> of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . Yes . Yep . So , now we have to come up with a decision . Of course . Mm . Can the company sell two million units ? Yep . Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? Could could I go to findings ? Yes . just to give everybody an idea of the market . So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh <disfmarker> it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could <vocalsound> you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . Yeah . We can . Great . I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh <disfmarker> Could could I go to findings ? Yep . Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering <vocalsound> I was thinking the same thing , yeah . Yes . and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . Directly . To the agents . Yeah . You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . Right , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon , Yes . don't you think ? Or eBay , or <disfmarker> Or eBay , yeah . Yes . Ah , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well . That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , Mm . whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And you can even have an <disfmarker> a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di Yeah . the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . The weight and feel . Weight , the feel of the product , but <disfmarker> We're getting used to that . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . Yeah .
'cause it's really really important . A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . <vocalsound> but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um <disfmarker> so , you're right , timing is very important , Yeah . Did you have something ? <vocalsound> Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . Okay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . <vocalsound> So no more changes will be made , okay , in this <disfmarker> the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the Second generation . second generation . <vocalsound> Okay . There's no end , there's not limit . <vocalsound> The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Every every custom Well , then it may not be . Okay . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . Like people don't like wood . <vocalsound> No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . <gap> very specific . Yes , but I'm not everybody . <vocalsound> I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , Yeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short <disfmarker> well you have no redesign <disfmarker> not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and <disfmarker> Yes .
pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh also <disfmarker> Yep . <vocalsound> That's actually good place to advertise it too . And to work with motion pictures . Yeah . <vocalsound> There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um <disfmarker> that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example . Yes . Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage . Mm-hmm . Yes , the <disfmarker> that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay . <vocalsound> That's great . <vocalsound> There's an idea . Going with um <disfmarker> Yeah , that's a good idea . To impro more profit and uh <disfmarker> Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? Hmm . Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ? The sports time . Sports season . Right before the Eur <vocalsound> the World Cup . <vocalsound> World soccer . World Cup soccer , Which sport season ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , that's a good idea . And and then um <disfmarker> but , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing Research . Mm-hmm .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . If we can go to to my display .
Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage . Mm-hmm . Yes , the <disfmarker> that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay . <vocalsound> That's great . <vocalsound>
and the meantime let's celebrate . and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . Okay for uh <disfmarker> but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over
That's the reason Ed is here . I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value . That's right . I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh <disfmarker> okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .
I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . Can also be on the side . Yeah , the sides maybe is good . Yeah .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . If we can go to to my display .
Yep . <vocalsound> That's actually good place to advertise it too . And to work with motion pictures . Yeah . <vocalsound> There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um <disfmarker> that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example . maybe what <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final <disfmarker> the the launch of a user-tested device with some <gap> special event . <vocalsound> Right , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon , Yes . don't you think ? Or eBay , or <disfmarker> Or eBay , yeah . Yes .
Second generation . Yes . well you have no redesign <disfmarker> not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and <disfmarker> Yeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short <disfmarker> Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . <vocalsound> So no more changes will be made , okay , in this <disfmarker> the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the
I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh <disfmarker> okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real . What turnaround time do we have ? Yes , the prototype uh <disfmarker> prototype product evaluation . In um <disfmarker> We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . Yes .
Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . Mm-hmm . because that <gap> has to be taken in into consideration . <vocalsound> Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh <disfmarker> Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro . <vocalsound> And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh <disfmarker> the cost of the unit for the company . Yes . Yes . Yep . Um-hmm . So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . Yes . It's gonna be very hard to reduce . Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . If we can go to to my display .
Did you have something ? <vocalsound> Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . Okay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . <vocalsound> So no more changes will be made , okay , in this <disfmarker> the basic design . Okay ? Okay . There's no end , there's not limit . <vocalsound> The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Every every custom Well , then it may not be . Okay . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . Like people don't like wood . <vocalsound> No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . <gap> very specific . Yes , but I'm not everybody . <vocalsound> I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , Yeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short <disfmarker> well you have no redesign <disfmarker> not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and <disfmarker> Yes .
Okay ? Um <vocalsound> I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do Mm ? Yes . and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . <vocalsound> Okay Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . <vocalsound> whatever you want it to do <vocalsound> 'Kay . um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . Mm-hmm . and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , And take out their wallet and buy it . So it's gotta be really attractive and it <disfmarker> 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . Yeah . Um <vocalsound> and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , What features . what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle <vocalsound> . S sellable . Yes <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . Yes . Okay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything . I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be <vocalsound> <disfmarker> And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . <vocalsound> Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?
Um the one thing for example <disfmarker> something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , Okay . Mm-hmm . and according to to higher management the <disfmarker> it should only control the T_V_ , <vocalsound> Um and the <disfmarker> Okay , so that's something <disfmarker> and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their <disfmarker> that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . <vocalsound> Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ? I have to wind up ? Yeah , sure . Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Okay .
but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the <disfmarker> a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . Yeah . Alright , thanks for that . Um alright now <vocalsound> other things that I found out on <disfmarker> in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent
so there should be wires . Okay . And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . Yeah exactly . There , mm-hmm . Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . Okay . Mm-hmm . The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . Multi-purpose . Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook <vocalsound> . Yo and it's <disfmarker> Yep . So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they <disfmarker> those we can make uh um like fluorescent Mm-hmm . uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's <disfmarker> this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands
And that <disfmarker> Mm-hmm colours . you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? To d the shape is uh <disfmarker> No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like , you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more <disfmarker> As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or <disfmarker> Yeah . Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in <disfmarker> having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah . but I think in principle that that would be <disfmarker> that would be kind of fun , you know . Yeah yeah . Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Silly for children . silly for children Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yes <vocalsound> . And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are <disfmarker> which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my <disfmarker> what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . Yeah , yeah you don't <vocalsound> us yeah yeah , usually . Yeah . <vocalsound> So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . Yeah shapes also , different shapes . You know , like the <disfmarker> a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it . Yeah that will <disfmarker> Yes . <vocalsound> And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's <disfmarker> so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands <vocalsound>
So this <disfmarker> these are just some thoughts I have on it , Mm-hmm . and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm ? Okay . Okay . As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . Mm-hmm . There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . Mm-hmm . Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice . On the on on the remote . So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . Yes . Mm-hmm . And uh the uh the uh and the <disfmarker> one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . Mm-hmm . Mm , 'kay . Mm-hmm . And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , uh like it can <disfmarker> it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
On my slide show basically we already <disfmarker> we have already done the agenda , and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . <vocalsound> Okay . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work . So these are the two things we should come up wit with . Don't T_V_ , yeah . There are a few but in general not . <vocalsound> Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have <disfmarker> we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , Mm-hmm . Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear . Yeah . And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . Mm-hmm . So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull . <vocalsound> Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . Mm-hmm . But I think <disfmarker> If we do some more research , maybe we <gap> . I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . Yeah . The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . Yeah . So that remains to s to be seen but <vocalsound> uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ . That's right , Yes . and can we <disfmarker> can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? Yeah , well that's that's the question . there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? Mm-hmm . They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , Yeah . Okay . and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have <disfmarker> you you have <disfmarker> you have for example uh <vocalsound> you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . Well there's a real idea yeah .
Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . If we do some more research , maybe we <gap> . I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . Mm-hmm . I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like <disfmarker> yeah . Do we agree , do we ? Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . Yeah , yeah , of course , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay ? Mm-hmm . So now I understand it's lunch break . And um .
Okay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible .

Um the one thing for example <disfmarker> something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Okay .
so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .

I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like <disfmarker> yeah . Do we agree , do we ? Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . Yeah , yeah , of course , yeah .
Uh , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess . Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . And uh so I'm <disfmarker> present myself . I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself . So I dunno , you can starts . <vocalsound> Okay , so my name is Petre <gap> . You can call me Petre <gap> , or Peter if you like . Uh my name's Bob Mor . And you are ? In the project ? Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . Oh , sorry . <gap> 'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . Bob , Bob yeah . okay . My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . Okay .
we are going to present the tool we are <vocalsound> we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . Um . Yeah and everything is <disfmarker> will be like this . Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all <disfmarker> during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So <gap> uh . Okay . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . Mm . Uh <vocalsound> . So uh <disfmarker> <gap> So I will ask you all to do the same . Okay . Just to get used to the whiteboard . So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? I I th I think I should . Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course <vocalsound> . Yeah go ahead .
So good um <disfmarker> So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell <disfmarker> we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . So <gap> n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . So , um . The <disfmarker> We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . Per unit , I guess .
<vocalsound> Yeah , of course . Y oh okay . Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything . Okay . Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very <disfmarker> they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um . Mm . Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light <vocalsound> , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . Yeah . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh <disfmarker> there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . Yeah . Yeah , but I can reach <disfmarker> In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . <gap> Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could <gap> <disfmarker> the the volume can go up very quickly Yeah . Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if <gap> you have some more notes on that . Do you have something ? just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune <gap> . Yeah , that's true .
Uh . The <disfmarker> So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and Um .
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . And for the Marketing uh Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh
And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . So good um <disfmarker> So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell <disfmarker> we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .
And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . So <gap> n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . Uh we are going to to sell <disfmarker> we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .
So , um . The <disfmarker> We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . Per unit , I guess .
Um how uh how we doing ? Yeah , good . Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . Mm-hmm . Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions And <vocalsound> even possibly a timer to <disfmarker> so that people can program <vocalsound> their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . Yes . Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Yeah . And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . Hmm . <vocalsound> Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip <vocalsound>
So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . Even a kid can use that . Mm-hmm . So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . <vocalsound> Can you go on to the next slide ? Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . Mm-hmm . Uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . And this comes with different colours , different shapes . Mm . attractive child interface . Next slide , please . Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . <vocalsound> This i this is one such interface which can be created . <vocalsound> And the personal preference <vocalsound> uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . <vocalsound> Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . Next , please . Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , by which <disfmarker> using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . Mm-hmm . Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the <gap> the subtitles on the screen . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . Now there should be a memory switch . There should be a mute button . Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch <disfmarker> he can uh <disfmarker> while talking he can watch the T_V_ . Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , <vocalsound> for example , if you want to see <disfmarker> we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the <disfmarker> uh yeah , the remote will <disfmarker> automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . Mm-hmm . So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . So this is one one of the interface which can be created . Mm-hmm . A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features . Then , please , next slide . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . Mm-hmm .
but if <disfmarker> I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah . Mm right . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ? Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . Mm-hmm . No suggestion's bad . Mm yes . But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . I don't think that we can get uh <disfmarker> Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . The components design . Mm-hmm . Okay .
uh if we <disfmarker> uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , Mm-hmm . Yeah , I have few pictures . When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's <vocalsound> it <disfmarker> this is a normal remote controller . Mm-hmm . And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , Mm-hmm . like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , Mm-hmm . Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um . uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d <vocalsound> diode transistors an Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . Mm-hmm . Uh you can also see the uh uh the green <disfmarker> two green things are uh these are <disfmarker> they are <disfmarker> they are resistors , Mm-hmm . So uh this is the circuit board . The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , Next , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like <vocalsound> instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please . Mm-hmm . I have just brief <vocalsound> uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . <vocalsound> Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Okay . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh <vocalsound> uh uh full <disfmarker> a complete chip . Okay . Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . Hmm , that's interesting . well thank you . Any particular comments by anybody ? yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . <vocalsound> And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it <disfmarker> you should <disfmarker> we should have a highly sophisticated one . Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh <vocalsound> be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . And uh it should be with uh <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> equipped with timer and alarm facility . And the uh other component we should <disfmarker> uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through <vocalsound> through through the uh remote controller Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh <vocalsound> which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .
uh if we <disfmarker> uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , Mm-hmm . Um . Next , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like <vocalsound> instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Okay . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh <vocalsound> uh uh full <disfmarker> a complete chip . Okay . hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , <vocalsound> you know , if you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if it falls down , then it doesn't <vocalsound> break . So it should be strong . Mm-hmm . Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh <vocalsound> which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . Mm-hmm . Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . <vocalsound> So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons .
Go right to my first <disfmarker> my next slide . Uh okay . Um alright , my method is uh <disfmarker> I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand . 'Kay . Simple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , and they don't <vocalsound> care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing .
So we've gotta narrow our selection down to <vocalsound> li <vocalsound> two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs <disfmarker> every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . Hmm . Okay . Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . Mm-hmm . Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? Yeah , but w This could be uh one feature which could be sellable . Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . I think that's <disfmarker> That that <gap> be really good , yeah , I agree with that . Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how <vocalsound> how uh far it will work , Mm-hmm . because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . Distance problem ? Well , you you teach <disfmarker> You have to teach uh <disfmarker> So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . <vocalsound> No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user ,
yeah . And <vocalsound> Not sure what they mean by supplements . And <disfmarker> Oh , like <disfmarker> Oh . Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . A what ? Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ? I think I think battery , Battery . Battery . Battery . and I think we all agreed on that . That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . Yes . we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful . Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . And compact . Trendy design and compact . Mm-hmm . Trendy design , compact and strong . Mm-hmm .
<vocalsound> Okay . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You will receive specific <vocalsound> instructions <vocalsound> will be sent to you by your coaches . Mm-hmm . this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to <vocalsound> uh come up with the user interface design , Mm-hmm . and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .
<vocalsound> and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to <vocalsound> uh come up with the user interface design , Mm-hmm . and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .
<vocalsound> Okay . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . Okay .
this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to <vocalsound> uh come up with the user interface design , Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> You will receive specific <vocalsound> instructions <vocalsound> will be sent to you by your coaches .
we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful . Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . And compact . Trendy design and compact . Mm-hmm . Trendy design , compact and strong . Mm-hmm .
I think I think battery , Battery . Battery . Battery . and I think we all agreed on that . That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . Yes . the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ?
That that <gap> be really good , yeah , I agree with that . Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how <vocalsound> how uh far it will work , Mm-hmm . because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . Distance problem ? Well , you you teach <disfmarker> You have to teach uh <disfmarker> So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . <vocalsound>
Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . Hmm .
and I have to discuss a few points on this . Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . And the second one is about uh the remote control . Should be used only for the T_V_ . That's what our uh management says . And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . Okay . so you have to be very quick . And I have come up with the <disfmarker> management come with the new proposal , okay ,
So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . I think um it could either be <disfmarker> you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um <vocalsound> uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the <disfmarker> of the user's home . Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups and , you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> if you uh mi one of <disfmarker> one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery . <vocalsound> Okay , <gap> . So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design . 'Kay , So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from <vocalsound> research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um <vocalsound> and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product <vocalsound> so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . <vocalsound> I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , you know , Yes . I <disfmarker> in addition to uh looking at the um <vocalsound> uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm <disfmarker> they <vocalsound> represent examples that are available today <vocalsound> <vocalsound> which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . Fantastic . <vocalsound> It'd be easy to find . And um it would uh y you'd <vocalsound> <disfmarker> you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . And since I'm not really um <vocalsound> Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . But um <vocalsound> I just <vocalsound> took some <vocalsound> different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . <gap> I don't know why um we were asked to do this . So , uh <vocalsound> personal preferences , <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . <vocalsound>
Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . Yes . Okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , <vocalsound> okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , Good idea . Good idea , thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . <vocalsound> Hmm . Titanium . Titanium would be <vocalsound> be heavy , too , Titanium . <vocalsound> No , I haven't really um <disfmarker> I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate <disfmarker> rank these , Yeah . but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts . Sure , yeah . No , I just wondering whether <disfmarker> that you had any sort of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I like titanium . It's light . Yeah . Expensive . Uh <vocalsound> yeah It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though <vocalsound> . Yeah
so then uh Ed , so can you tell about <disfmarker> Okay , from the marketing <disfmarker> yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s S 'scuse me for one sec . I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . Okay ? I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a <disfmarker> in the recent surveys , uh from the ages <disfmarker> fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . <vocalsound> Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . That's a market price right now . Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , Yep . but give them added things that they don't have now , Yep . then it w it could possibly sell . Obviously the risk is there . Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting <disfmarker> two things that are interesting <gap> is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . <vocalsound> Speech recognition? . And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . Mm-hmm . Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . <vocalsound> Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . <vocalsound> Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . <vocalsound> But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy <disfmarker> easy to use , if it's got simple remote <disfmarker> speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . So we're gonna have to look at it in a <vocalsound> in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . <vocalsound> But , price obviously we have to talk about . Yep . uh I'm sorry ? <vocalsound> What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about <disfmarker> of the speech recognition ? Speech recognition . <vocalsound> Well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands . Mm-hmm . So um <disfmarker> might uh <disfmarker> we can perhaps um <vocalsound> do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . Not sure how . <vocalsound> But um anyway , um <vocalsound> I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh <vocalsound> y you know sen send power to it . So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there Hmm . so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote . Very good point . Because tha w <vocalsound> with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea but th <vocalsound> the radio can be on and everything . Yep . Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone <vocalsound> <disfmarker> it has a exact word that it has to hear . Mm-hmm . I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote ,
Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh <disfmarker> the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . I don't think it's uh the difficult . And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what <gap> today . Okay ,
we'll find that out . Yep . From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . Yes . What do they want ? Yes . Uh <vocalsound> , a risk , take a risk on the market ? Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? Yes . Yep . Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . Yeah but And it's gonna cost . but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back <vocalsound> okay . It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us Mm-hmm . okay . And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of Obviously . Mm . okay . The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay .
where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . <vocalsound> Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities <vocalsound> that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . Click mm . Oh , it's um , seems <vocalsound> very understandable . Clearly your research and uh <disfmarker> and ours uh heading in the same direction , Yep . and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . <vocalsound> so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary . Yeah . I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design Mm-hmm . Yeah . and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , Yeah . and uh , you're <disfmarker> Oh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an <disfmarker> daily basis in a lot of cases , I think . First . So <vocalsound> for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , Oh <disfmarker> and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . And then , what the good ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons <disfmarker> it's not clear what they're supposed to do . Um often , you need to know specific button sequences <vocalsound> to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . And that the buttons are too small . So , here we've got two examples
okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , Yeah . 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? Hmm . Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ? Sure . and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should <vocalsound> do as many features as uh <disfmarker> start with all of them right now I thought <disfmarker> No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but <disfmarker> Oh th <vocalsound> we s we still have <disfmarker> I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , guess <disfmarker> 'cause w our meeting time has run out . Yeah .
Individual actions . <vocalsound> Well it says individual actions , it says user interf Yep . so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , Mm-hmm . and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should <vocalsound> do as many features as uh <disfmarker> start with all of them right now I thought <disfmarker> and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .
it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept ,
so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , Mm-hmm .
supposed to work on the user interface concept , Mm-hmm . and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh <disfmarker> the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay ,
Oh th <vocalsound> we s we still have <disfmarker> I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , guess <disfmarker> 'cause w our meeting time has run out . Yeah . and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should <vocalsound> do as many features as uh <disfmarker> start with all of them right now I thought <disfmarker> and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .
make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . Click mm . Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . Yes . <vocalsound> Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . <vocalsound> and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy <disfmarker> easy to use , if it's got simple remote <disfmarker> speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . Okay , and it will be slim , okay ,
okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , Yeah . 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? Hmm . and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should <vocalsound> do as many features as uh <disfmarker> start with all of them right now I thought <disfmarker> and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion . No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but <disfmarker> Oh th <vocalsound> we s we still have <disfmarker> I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , guess <disfmarker>
they want something uh new , okay . I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , okay . I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay . Mm . we'll find that out . Yep . From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . Yes . What do they want ? Yes . The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked ,
Oops . So , hello everyone . <vocalsound> We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a <disfmarker> f for the beginning of new project um <vocalsound> uh remote control for the design for a new remote control <vocalsound> . I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov <vocalsound> So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . <vocalsound> Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . <gap> and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . Um , so <vocalsound> let's try the whiteboard <vocalsound> .
Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . <gap> and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . Um , so <vocalsound> let's try the whiteboard <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so any of you who want to go . Yeah , for favourite animals . <vocalsound> It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . <vocalsound>
Yeah , <vocalsound> 'tis big number . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> On the international market . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , we're to sell two million then . <vocalsound> Wow . Mm-hmm . Mm <vocalsound> for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . <vocalsound> 'Kay <vocalsound> . Next . <vocalsound> Next . Let's talk about money . Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . <vocalsound> So . So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
<vocalsound> 'tis big number . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> On the international market . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , we're to sell two million then . <vocalsound>
Mm <vocalsound> for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . <vocalsound> 'Kay <vocalsound> . So any of you have experience in remote controls ? <vocalsound> Uh yes , we have plenty at home . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So that could be a great um <vocalsound> application . Remote controls children proof . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh <vocalsound> high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it has to be nice looking , Yeah . colourful , maybe <disfmarker> Colourful , yeah mm . colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control Yeah . No , that's a good idea . Yeah , it's always black or <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh Oh like the phones , like the phones and these things we c yeah . yeah , it could change colours , yeah . Good . Good idea . And it should be really <gap> small and <gap> . Small also ? Don't you think <disfmarker> No uh , not too much buttons or <disfmarker> mm . Yeah , not too much buttons and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control Mm-hmm . Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like <gap> . Hmm . But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh maybe we can change the colours that <disfmarker> at least the frame . Yeah , at least the colour would be different . Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame <gap> . I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're <disfmarker> they never find a good button in the right place . Yeah , yeah . So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um <vocalsound> cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what <disfmarker> I dunno <gap> . No , no screens , it's too complex . no . Okay . <vocalsound> Too expensive for twelve Euro ? Mm . <vocalsound> Too expensive , yeah . so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? huh . Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . On off ? We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a <vocalsound> If it <disfmarker> if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . Sh sure , sure . But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have <disfmarker> you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . Mm . <vocalsound> Because I'm only using three or four channels but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put <disfmarker> yeah , you can only have one bit . Yeah . m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . Dash . And then back to the one I was before , Also we can be here <disfmarker> Yeah you can <disfmarker> yeah . yeah , that would be cool . Go back button is good . Yeah .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So that could be a great um <vocalsound> application . Remote controls children proof . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh <vocalsound> high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it has to be nice looking , Yeah . colourful , maybe <disfmarker> Colourful , yeah mm . colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control Yeah . No , that's a good idea . Yeah , it's always black or <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah even we can change colours , no ?

So I think we have full of idea . Okay . Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm <vocalsound> work on these ideas and try to make a uh <vocalsound> the ones , <vocalsound> make um <disfmarker> to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . <vocalsound> And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . <vocalsound> So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ? Market Expert . Marketing <disfmarker> yeah <vocalsound> <gap> . Mm . <vocalsound> Uh that's me . <vocalsound> Oh , of course <vocalsound> yeah , <vocalsound> the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .
Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm <vocalsound> work on these ideas and try to make a uh <vocalsound> the ones , <vocalsound> make um <disfmarker> to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . <vocalsound> And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .
and uh I want you to mm <vocalsound> work on these ideas and try to make a uh <vocalsound> the ones , <vocalsound> make um <disfmarker> to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . <vocalsound> And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um .
Yeah , <vocalsound> So . So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
Mm <vocalsound> for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . <vocalsound> 'Kay <vocalsound> . Wow . Mm-hmm .
Remote controls children proof . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> So that could be a great um <vocalsound> application .
colourful , maybe <disfmarker> Colourful , yeah mm . colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control Yeah . No , that's a good idea . Yeah , it's always black or <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh Oh like the phones , like the phones and these things we c yeah . yeah , it could change colours , yeah . <vocalsound> it has to be nice looking , Yeah .
so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? huh . Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . On off ? We can adapt only one switch , But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh maybe we can change the colours that <disfmarker> at least the frame . Yeah , at least the colour would be different . suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
yeah , that would be cool . Go back button is good . Yeah . <disfmarker> yeah .
Good . Good idea . And it should be really <gap> small and <gap> . Small also ? Don't you think <disfmarker> Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like <gap> . Hmm .
<vocalsound> Too expensive for twelve Euro ? Mm . <vocalsound> Too expensive , yeah . So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um <vocalsound> cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what <disfmarker> I dunno <gap> . No , no screens , it's too complex . no . Okay .
<vocalsound> If it <disfmarker> if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . Sh sure , sure . We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have <disfmarker> you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . Mm . <vocalsound> Because I'm only using three or four channels but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put <disfmarker> yeah , you can only have one bit . Yeah .
<vocalsound> So uh we were looking he specifically at the components uh <disfmarker> the following components , <vocalsound> uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , <vocalsound> you have to have microphone <disfmarker> well no you don't actually I haven't <disfmarker> have to have microphone in the device , but um <vocalsound> maybe you do have it a a way <disfmarker> it has to it has to hear the speaker Mm-hmm . and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we <disfmarker> So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um <disfmarker> we wanted to evaluate some new materials <vocalsound> and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might <vocalsound> come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um <disfmarker> our research . <vocalsound> So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh <disfmarker> we can really seriously explore , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so then we were thinking about um rubber , <vocalsound> but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor <vocalsound> and th um there might be some <vocalsound> problems with the m uh how it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh goes with the board . <vocalsound> Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle <disfmarker> it gets brittle after a while , <vocalsound> so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , <vocalsound> the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how <vocalsound> Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . <vocalsound> So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which <vocalsound> I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , <vocalsound> and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , <vocalsound> which w 'member the beam was <disfmarker> that was an important component of finding the right chip . <vocalsound> And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research Let's go back up here . Yes , uh <gap> question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um <vocalsound> and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . <vocalsound> I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . Okay , tha that would be great ,
so that would be good . Sounds good . Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? Because um it gets brittle , cracks <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Um We want <disfmarker> we expect these um <vocalsound> uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So . <vocalsound> I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh it's <disfmarker> I'm not su <vocalsound> So <gap> so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . Actually , I'm ready to sell it . <vocalsound> <gap> you're what ? I'm ready to sell it . I think <vocalsound> if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , <vocalsound> You think ? No y <vocalsound> no no no , but you can't just use <disfmarker> the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , Yeah , exactly , yeah . <vocalsound> Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . <vocalsound> although how <vocalsound> Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One thing we'd have to check though is what the users <disfmarker> whether <disfmarker> how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your <disfmarker> <disfmarker> Yeah , for example . <vocalsound> So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , <vocalsound> now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , <vocalsound> you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a <disfmarker> this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , So this is the findings of our research <vocalsound> and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?
<vocalsound> So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , <vocalsound> so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . Mm-hmm . And also <vocalsound> um you had issues with the batteries running out , <vocalsound> so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is <disfmarker> starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . Mm-hmm . Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . <vocalsound> And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ <vocalsound> and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip <vocalsound> thing and <disfmarker> Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . <vocalsound> A hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . Mm-hmm . Mm . But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , <vocalsound> you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . So , that's pretty much <vocalsound> all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and <vocalsound> the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , <vocalsound> so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , Mm-hmm . the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . Mm . Mm-hmm . So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . I think so , yeah . Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . <vocalsound> Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .
Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . Mm-hmm . So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , <vocalsound> uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay , I also have a f <vocalsound> very simple presentation , Mm-hmm . because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I also have uh copied a different type of remote . If you can find me , where I'm at . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They're stealing our product . <vocalsound> We've been giving simple <vocalsound> questionnaires in different areas because th <gap> obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . <vocalsound> 'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh <disfmarker> from the <vocalsound> questionnaires from the the <disfmarker> all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become <disfmarker> has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they <gap> look <disfmarker> it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . <vocalsound> The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The first one , I see <vocalsound> that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . Right . <vocalsound> Okay Because I've seen <disfmarker> mostly the standard ones ,
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um <vocalsound> a uh <vocalsound> uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , , we might've <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific <disfmarker> you'd know what kind of wood to get . But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if <disfmarker> unless everyone has their own personal remote . <vocalsound> That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . <vocalsound> and from <disfmarker> Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . <vocalsound> Although , what it <disfmarker> was it uh <disfmarker> it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . Mm-hmm . Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face Yeah . <vocalsound> Right , mm . and then they sold millions , millions . And that took off , yeah , yeah . We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um <vocalsound> labour laws . <vocalsound> You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . Yeah . So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh <vocalsound> , countries like , uh , India Cost of living is low . We're here to design , come up with a nice product . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get <disfmarker> to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking .
Don't looks nice uh . Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . Mm-hmm . but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design <vocalsound> whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display <vocalsound> right in front of you . Yeah . Hmm . So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . Hmm . I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for <disfmarker> Hmm . he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? <vocalsound> No . No <vocalsound> Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? <gap> no p spec <vocalsound> I will market it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Once we get a price on it then we can market it . <vocalsound>
then uh , then we can proceed from there . Okay . I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . <vocalsound> And a marketing strategy . An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . And marketing strategy , thank you . Mm-hmm . Okay . So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . Okay . Okay , so , any questions ? No . So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay ,
then uh , then we can proceed from there . Mm-hmm . Okay . So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . Okay . Okay , so , any questions ? No . So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay ,

<vocalsound> So the <vocalsound> the advanced chip on print is what um what we've <vocalsound> we've deci we've determined <vocalsound> and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . A customisable and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> then we can have a business tie-up and to get <disfmarker> to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> So the <vocalsound> the advanced chip on print is what um what we've <vocalsound> we've deci we've determined <vocalsound> and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . A customisable and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . <vocalsound> What about the buttons , would <disfmarker> Would the buttons be wood too , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh I don't think so , no , I don't think so . I think they could be rubber like they are now , Yes . <vocalsound> and from <disfmarker> Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . <vocalsound> um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , <vocalsound> you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a <disfmarker> this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display <vocalsound> right in front of you . Yeah . Hmm . So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . Hmm .

No <vocalsound> Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? <gap> no p spec <vocalsound> I will market it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Once we get a price on it then we can market it . <vocalsound>
Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh <vocalsound> , countries like , uh , India Cost of living is low . We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um <vocalsound> labour laws . <vocalsound> You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
so that would be good . Sounds good . Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? Because um it gets brittle , cracks <disfmarker> but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh <disfmarker> we can really seriously explore , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so then we were thinking about um rubber , <vocalsound> but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor <vocalsound> and th um there might be some <vocalsound> problems with the m uh how it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh goes with the board . <vocalsound> Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle <disfmarker> it gets brittle after a while , <vocalsound> so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , <vocalsound> although how <vocalsound> Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . <vocalsound>
So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . Hmm . I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for <disfmarker> Hmm . he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? <vocalsound> No . No <vocalsound> Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? <gap> no p spec <vocalsound>
uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . Okay . Uh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . <vocalsound> And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh <vocalsound> visited . <vocalsound> <gap> information . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I will take notes Okay . At the end , uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Welcome to the conceptual design meeting <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Wow . Right . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components . <vocalsound> Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . Mm-hmm . Uh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and <gap> how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . <vocalsound> I'm sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> senior citizens uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ye Ah , it's <vocalsound> it's okay . Okay . Go on . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> They , well , they like more the <disfmarker> they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . <vocalsound> Wood and chrome . <vocalsound> And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . Mm-hmm . But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . Well , y you could just go for a battery . Hmm . Or you can go for both ? Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? Yeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably . W <gap> nah . Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . Mm . But you prefer kinetic ? So <disfmarker> I I prefer kinetic because it's uh <disfmarker> well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . Okay . But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a <disfmarker> well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's <gap> like several different dimensions . That gives you an whole new uh effec Dynamic dynamic look ? Hmm . Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later . Oh , okay . A little artistic . Yeah you could <disfmarker> y It leaves more space for creativity . Okay . Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You <disfmarker> We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It's soft . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And uh chip set , A combination , yeah . A combination . Uh , <gap> you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up . What uh what do you think ? You agree ? I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . Yeah ? Both ? Yeah okay , but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . Mm yeah . That that would solve the problem . That's <disfmarker> it's custom customisable and <disfmarker> Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it . Mm yeah . So mm <disfmarker> Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber .
Or you can go for both ? Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? But you prefer kinetic ? So <disfmarker> I I prefer kinetic because it's uh <disfmarker> well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . Okay . we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a <disfmarker> well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's <gap> like several different dimensions . That gives you an whole new uh effec Dynamic dynamic look ? Hmm . Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later . Oh , okay . A little artistic . Yeah you could <disfmarker> y It leaves more space for creativity . Okay . Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You <disfmarker> We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It's soft . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . Mm-hmm . But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . Well , y you could just go for a battery . Hmm .
What uh what do you think ? You agree ? But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . Yeah ? Both ? A combination , yeah . A combination . Uh , <gap> you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up .
Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris <vocalsound> to amuse the younger users . <vocalsound> Okay , and um <disfmarker> And third , I stick with it , <vocalsound> the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Last week <vocalsound> I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . <vocalsound> For marketing . Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um <vocalsound> what they like in design uh and material nowadays . Findings . Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . At first , the colours of fruit . <vocalsound> Very basic colours , like Janus explained . Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , considering material , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . They like spongy material , <vocalsound> It's nice , I think . Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , uh materials like wood that <disfmarker> Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you <disfmarker> which you build a a remote control of . 'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy . Um , they should be technological in innovative . That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common . My personal preferences . We have to aim at a mu at the <gap> main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . Would you prefer uh uh <gap> that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , exactly . <vocalsound> Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function <vocalsound> uh recognition . <vocalsound> So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh <disfmarker> Yeah , like something . You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak <disfmarker> uh speech recognition and stuff . Okay . Well , I do that , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Kay , second .
'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy . Um , they should be technological in innovative . That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common .
Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris <vocalsound> to amuse the younger users . <vocalsound> Well , I do that , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , and um <disfmarker> And third , I stick with it , <vocalsound> the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But that's common . My personal preferences . We have to aim at a mu at the <gap> main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . Would you prefer uh uh <gap> that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , exactly . <vocalsound> Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function <vocalsound> uh recognition . <vocalsound> So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh <disfmarker> Yeah , like something . You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak <disfmarker> uh speech recognition and stuff . Okay . 'Kay , second .
Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . Maybe even li like this with uh <vocalsound> u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's <disfmarker> So you can use it in uh in this way . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . <vocalsound> And else , to one and through after that . So the s a button less . And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . Things like um um <disfmarker> That you can switch switch easy . Well yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . Yeah it is .
That you can switch switch easy . Well yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . Yeah it is . And else , to one and through after that . So the s a button less . And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . Things like um um <disfmarker>
Oh , okay . Uh <disfmarker> I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . <vocalsound> There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh <disfmarker> I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it . Yeah but <disfmarker> What I see uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . Yeah . And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to <disfmarker> It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . Yeah , ok Why <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . You c may use <disfmarker> like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Well <disfmarker> I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . I don't know what <disfmarker> Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , <vocalsound> Well , maybe um some idea on that . Yeah . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , Yeah . But , well , if you want to <disfmarker> I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up <vocalsound> for instance . Yeah . What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much . A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . Yeah . But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming <vocalsound> one , and you f the channel switches , uh <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But <disfmarker> Yeah . So that will uh <disfmarker> that that that must be in it , you think ? Yeah , that will be nice . Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are Optional in But how we do it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Yeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh <disfmarker> Like the first idea uh from uh <disfmarker> You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . Yeah , but most often not . Yeah . That is true , that is true . Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . Yeah . Yeah , j just some rules . But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . No , no , it's very simple . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . Yeah . Yeah ? I'm listening . Um , the views . Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . Like a like a moat or s or something . In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . Yeah , but you have that in the <disfmarker> What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . Yeah . We take it to the other meeting , okay ?
And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games <gap> are in it . Uh , too uh too many levels .
<vocalsound> Okay . Go on . <vocalsound> What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Import export . <vocalsound> and uh then we uh finish . <vocalsound> A little chat . <vocalsound> I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh <disfmarker> can come in handy uh for us . <vocalsound> First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is <gap> uh like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's uh very hot at the moment , <vocalsound> so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh Marketing .
R_ three . Real Reaction remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . Oh . Mm-hmm ? When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a <disfmarker> just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . Uh , logo . Yeah ? And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . And then you go uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a <disfmarker> as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . And it it l linger on every time you see it . Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can <gap> you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . <gap> Yeah . And it could just stay there . That spins around like all the time . Mm yep , But we we are uh <disfmarker> It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer . Yeah yeah y yeah yeah .
N <vocalsound> Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Who uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , very special , uh next uh session . Uh idea that you uh <disfmarker> the the industrial uh development uh centre <vocalsound> and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . So that's a kinda new uh thing . Ah . And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email . Um <disfmarker> So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> P_ . But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen . Ah , no new email . See you in a half hour . Hey . But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh Yeah , uh I'm not sure if we uh we <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Uh , very special , uh next uh session . Uh idea that you uh <disfmarker> the the industrial uh development uh centre <vocalsound> and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . So that's a kinda new uh thing . Ah . And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
<vocalsound> What uh what do you think ? You agree ? I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . Yeah ? Both ? A combination , yeah . A combination . Uh , <gap> you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up . <vocalsound> Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that <disfmarker> Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .
<vocalsound> The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that <disfmarker> with cover is removable . <vocalsound> So mm <disfmarker> Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . Yeah , me too . <vocalsound> Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that <disfmarker> Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .
The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh <disfmarker> Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And uh chip set ,
So that will uh <disfmarker> that that that must be in it , you think ? Yeah , that will be nice . Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . Uh , too uh too many levels . And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games <gap> are in it .
Yeah , that will be nice . Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But <disfmarker> Yeah .
Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . Mm yeah . I have a little problems with my laptop . Okay . And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete . Okay . What was it , problem ? Um , it didn't work anymore . <vocalsound> The laptop ? The entire Windows uh <disfmarker> It hang <disfmarker> hung .
Yeah but <disfmarker> What I see uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . Yeah . And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to <disfmarker> It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . Yeah , ok Why <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . You c may use <disfmarker> like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are Okay . Well <disfmarker> I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . Optional in But how we do it ? <vocalsound> And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . I don't know what <disfmarker> Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Yeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh <disfmarker> Like the first idea uh from uh <disfmarker> You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well , maybe um some idea on that . Yeah . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , Yeah . Mm yeah . Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . Yeah , but most often not . Yeah . That is true , that is true . Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . Yeah . Yeah , j just some rules . But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . No , no , it's very simple . But , well , if you want to <disfmarker> I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up <vocalsound> for instance . Yeah . What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . Yeah .
Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . <vocalsound> Uh y getting close to the last Don't be sarcastic . <vocalsound> Mark . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Uh Rama . <vocalsound> Ramaro . Um um we have to take a decision on the control <disfmarker> remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . Mm . So what we want to <disfmarker> the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um <vocalsound> a trend watching on what he's <disfmarker> he's been doing . It's <disfmarker>
So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use <vocalsound> traditional solar cells or <disfmarker> mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ Ah . and then uh titanium , which can be <disfmarker> which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some <gap> , moving <gap> kind of thing . as we discussed before , we need to <disfmarker> we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and <disfmarker> which can use microphone <gap> sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to <disfmarker> in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . Mm-hmm , okay . <vocalsound> Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells Mm-hmm . and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or <disfmarker> and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . What is a double-curved shape ? <vocalsound> Like you can have two curves . Uh-huh . Uh it's <disfmarker> I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser <disfmarker> uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ <vocalsound> which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> we want to reduce uh cost . <vocalsound> Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . The cost . Uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> And also like in <disfmarker> if you put a <gap> it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Okay . You m titanium it's more uh <disfmarker> Yeah . W we can use something like you know <vocalsound> the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like Okay . <gap> yeah . But full assembly <disfmarker> We'll use mainly for titanium <gap> Okay . rubber is expensive Okay . and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . Okay . And this push buttons Uh yeah so <disfmarker> we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo Speech <disfmarker> Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , Mm-hmm . and still we have <disfmarker> mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? L_C_D_ . Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . So uh Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and <disfmarker> Okay , so let's try it , because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or <gap> or something let's t so we want to reduce the cost on display <gap> The L_C_D_ would <disfmarker> The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . Just uh for output , I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light . Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries Okay . for really light batteries and with uh good price . So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be <disfmarker> ask . Yeah , it's always like that . We have dreams and the <disfmarker> in the end we find out that it's not feasible . <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> mm .
the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no <gap> ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control . <vocalsound> maybe you can use <gap> in the end and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> doesn't make sense . This is very <vocalsound> ugly . Really ? <vocalsound> Ah okay just press the button , please uh . <vocalsound> too much concept . Ah . Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But instead of this I will devise <disfmarker> That's our concept . Ah , back today . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . Mm-hmm . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> Uh so
I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . Okay . But <disfmarker> yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So I just want to say it should be real smart . Maybe fingerprint recognition or <disfmarker> So since we have <disfmarker> we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use <disfmarker> So it could be smart in that way . yeah . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh <disfmarker> things like that Yeah . that might be expensive but Hmm . <vocalsound> The remote that knows you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . Mm-hmm . <gap> Do you think it can come in several colours ? And everyone's gonna be satisfied . Or did the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . Um but not the case . Not the case . Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? they like uh something which is uh <disfmarker> Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option Do you like it ? 'cause it's nasty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . No . Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Mm-hmm . Maybe we can just <disfmarker> if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . Um , I am here . so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we <disfmarker> if you want o more colours <vocalsound> on L_C_D_ , Yeah . Okay , what uh <disfmarker> there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <vocalsound> 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , Lights , yeah . Mm . but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . If if if the <disfmarker> Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . so <disfmarker> Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but <disfmarker> and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of <vocalsound> uh o or this is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . <vocalsound> It might be optional , yeah . Okay . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Mm-hmm . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? Seems important . Hmm . That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light , Mm <gap> glow in the dark , Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And um the remote control's going to be smart Oh . but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? <vocalsound> and to mm to <disfmarker> Well so
yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , <vocalsound> Uh to be to be quick <vocalsound> there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are <disfmarker> uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very <disfmarker> pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , <gap> it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh <vocalsound> it first have to be very nice , uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so <disfmarker> currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of <vocalsound> of look or feel <vocalsound> so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And I think of course uh <vocalsound> i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . <vocalsound> It it can travel f from clothe to furniture <vocalsound> same idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . <vocalsound> And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , Mm . <vocalsound> kind of um maybe <disfmarker> <gap> When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important Yeah it <disfmarker> because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . Mm-hmm . S Yeah . So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . Seems not , seems not . Um <vocalsound> sorry Mark . It seems to be <disfmarker> Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , Fruit . Even shape ? as a <disfmarker> even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> More <gap> Yeah . And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . Mm-hmm . Mm you have questions ? So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's <disfmarker> This <disfmarker> you you <gap> so did you <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , Where ? that are also <disfmarker> Yeah . It's more general trend well . it's not particular to the remote control . No , it's not it's not <disfmarker> this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . Mm . The <disfmarker> what we <disfmarker> Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy Sure . or <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to <disfmarker> I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables yeah yeah . looking <disfmarker> yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . or at least <disfmarker> If if it's something like rubber made or <disfmarker> I think it it's also going to be good . Yeah .
So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , Look and feel de um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm um and I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . Okay . Yeah you're right , you have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's <disfmarker> So we want to follow general trend . you say s <vocalsound> No , we don't have to , do you think <disfmarker> but seems it's the trend . Hmm . Yeah . Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . yeah are we confident enough on creating trends ? Well , Well , we can make it smell like fruit . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> that's a good idea , <vocalsound> So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like <disfmarker> They more want these fancy features Uh <disfmarker> i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us Mm-hmm . Okay . It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . <vocalsound> Yeah . I I agree with uh this uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , <vocalsound> or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options Maybe you could explore the two option . and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean <gap> fruit-shaped . Uh yeah <gap> at least like we can make banana or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Don't you say that you cannot do double shape <disfmarker> uh curved shape <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> yeah Doub double-curved . Mm . Seems to be <gap> . we're to look for <gap> Mm-hmm . Okay . and and s we're to see the <disfmarker> whether rubber is expensive Okay , okay . and d In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the <disfmarker> like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . Hmm . Mm-mm . Okay , so w we'll see . you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Yeah Yeah . Maybe we can have two different <gap> assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy Uh . explore a shape . So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or <disfmarker> <gap> Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . Yeah . Okay . Not uh <disfmarker> The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says <disfmarker> if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . Yeah , Yeah . Mm . That's the converse to having zillions of button Mm . Yeah . where each button does only one thing . Mm . Yeah . Okay . and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Anyway it's very <disfmarker> in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So . <vocalsound> Because the trend goes faster than the life of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , Look and feel de um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation .
um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Mm-hmm . Look and feel de
and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . Hmm .
we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons Yeah you're right , you have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , so so
we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , yeah , so so
we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's <disfmarker>
still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or <disfmarker> <gap> Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . Yeah .
and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or <disfmarker> Yeah .
Mm . but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . If if if the <disfmarker> And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . Mm-hmm . <gap> Do you think it can come in several colours ? And everyone's gonna be satisfied . Or did the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . Um but not the case . Not the case . Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? they like uh something which is uh <disfmarker> Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option Do you like it ? 'cause it's nasty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . No . Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Mm-hmm . Maybe we can just <disfmarker> if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . Um , I am here . so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we <disfmarker> if you want o more colours <vocalsound> on L_C_D_ , Yeah . Okay , what uh <disfmarker> there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <vocalsound> 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , Lights , yeah .
if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . Um , I am here . <vocalsound> I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more <vocalsound> because of <vocalsound> uh o or this is <disfmarker> so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we <disfmarker> if you want o more colours <vocalsound> on L_C_D_ , Yeah . It might be optional , yeah . Okay . 'cause it's nasty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . No . Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Mm-hmm . Maybe we can just <disfmarker>
Okay . But <disfmarker> yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So I just want to say it should be real smart . Maybe fingerprint recognition or <disfmarker> So since we have <disfmarker> we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use <disfmarker> So it could be smart in that way . yeah . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh <disfmarker> things like that Yeah . Hmm . <vocalsound> The remote that knows you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And um the remote control's going to be smart Oh . but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? <vocalsound>
Yeah . Mm-mm . Okay , so w we'll see . you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Yeah Yeah . Maybe we can have two different <gap> assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . Mm . When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important Yeah it <disfmarker> because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . Mm-hmm . S Yeah . So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . Seems not , seems not . and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or <disfmarker> and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . What is a double-curved shape ? Okay . <gap> yeah . But full assembly <disfmarker> We'll use mainly for titanium <gap> Okay . I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . or at least <disfmarker> If if it's something like rubber made or <disfmarker> I think it it's also going to be good .
but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like we want to follow general trend . you say s yeah <vocalsound> No , we don't have to , do you think <disfmarker> but seems it's the trend . Hmm . Yeah . Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . we want to reduce uh cost . <vocalsound> Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . The cost . are we confident enough on creating trends ? Well , You m titanium it's more uh <disfmarker> Yeah . W we can use something like you know <vocalsound> the whole body's titanium
So So <disfmarker> I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . Of course . <vocalsound> Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know <disfmarker> to <disfmarker> at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the <disfmarker> from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um <vocalsound> third part <vocalsound> uh I don't remember <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .
Well I'll check uh with my Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . Oh , okay , So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Who starts ? Twenty five . <vocalsound> but we have to take this into account . Uh . <vocalsound> We met before . So as you know , you <disfmarker> I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . <vocalsound> Ah <vocalsound> now I remember what is R_S_I_ <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it's repetitivity stress injury . <vocalsound> We have to be careful with that word Mm-hmm . Mm . So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um <vocalsound> Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . <vocalsound> Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were <disfmarker> people are ready to pay for nice and look <disfmarker> and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in <disfmarker> and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it <disfmarker> the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . <vocalsound> Now <vocalsound> people are very frustrated w with their <vocalsound> remote controls <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and they for instance uh they don't even find it <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it's <vocalsound> it's often lost somewhere in the in the <disfmarker> in your home and nobody knows where it is . Yeah . Maybe if we have something where we could <vocalsound> ask the remote control please , where are you ? Agree . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Like uh something to to <disfmarker> like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone But why not ? Yeah . <vocalsound> And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , Hmm . so most of the the people say they they don't know how to <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . <vocalsound>
Mm . In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than <disfmarker> more than <disfmarker> then teletext is used less . Mm-hmm . Then teletext is useless for them I think , Okay . yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ah yeah . Mm-hmm . So we've listed a couple of uh Functions . s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you <vocalsound> use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used <disfmarker> very often used and indeed uh very relevant . channel selection is um very important , very often used . <vocalsound> Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , Not very relevant , so Hmm . if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . For instance I think <disfmarker> net next slide . <vocalsound> One of the thing <disfmarker> the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility <disfmarker> the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> the relevance goes down . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . 'Cause <disfmarker> If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they <disfmarker> this should be so now I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , should we aim at the young people or not ? I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are <disfmarker> they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .
t because <disfmarker> So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , Yeah . just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah . Yeah . Yeah so <disfmarker> but you have to <disfmarker> Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Mm-hmm . Or say this can be back . Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press <disfmarker> suppose two five they just press two and five Okay . Yeah . Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode <disfmarker> zapping mode or Yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> Listening more . but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls Yeah . so we can have more functions for T_V_ Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm-hmm . Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? Well <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . <vocalsound> However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist <vocalsound> that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . <vocalsound> And uh a general method which is <disfmarker> seems to be very useful for our task Mm . is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . Makes sense . <vocalsound> So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one <vocalsound> I guess this . Yeah , yeah . I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh <disfmarker> I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . Sure , sure . Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe it can be yeah middle of <disfmarker> like , between those two Yeah , Okay . Oh sorry . Our question of the style , we should remember that our company <vocalsound> puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . So be simple . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . <vocalsound> It's a really good style , it going to be <disfmarker> look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , Mm-hmm . and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , Press <disfmarker> <gap> I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium Mm . and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , It's off . Hmm . It's on . the T_V_ turns on . And when does it turn off ? When you don't touch the control but you go out of the <disfmarker> Oh For for enough time so you have a Tech <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . Or you want to go to the kitchen . <vocalsound> It's easy to do , you just control the <disfmarker> According to your distance to <disfmarker> and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . Distance . According to the distance . <gap> Yeah yeah yeah . Uh I'm not sure about the screen , So <disfmarker> wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . So it gives instructions Yeah . but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . <gap> So , Okay . Mm . So basically that's it . <vocalsound> Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . Can be easily done , Yeah . All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment Mm . Yeah and it <disfmarker> mm . and then maybe m make it more generalised <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , okay . Okay , but it's quite universal you know . Mm . We can just extend it to any device . Mm . So for instance if I want to go to <disfmarker> directly to channel twenty five , how would I do <disfmarker> can I do that with this ? Uh twenty five . Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> In fact I would propose another solution . Or is it ? Basically you use just four or five channels , Most people <disfmarker> Yeah . So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . B yeah . But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number Go to channel twenty five . and then it go One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .
You prefer it <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh <disfmarker> like digital calculators and electronic calculators . <vocalsound> So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what <disfmarker> to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . <vocalsound> And usually this <disfmarker> so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages <disfmarker> these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device <gap> remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are <disfmarker> I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . Mm-hmm . Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so Mm . or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . Okay . So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes . Okay . and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , Mm-hmm . so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you <disfmarker> can you make it on the whiteboard , or <disfmarker> mm . Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface <gap> speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Mm . this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user No , even in <disfmarker> you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , Okay . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . And what about the price of this component ? So <disfmarker> Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , It mm <disfmarker> and we want to make really simple device Cheap . because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like Mm-hmm . and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume Mm-hmm . or or it will be something like volume , up , down . Ye yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words Okay . Couple of words . and and because we can't really say user to say same wording Mm-hmm mm . Okay . Um . And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , Of course uh it has to be <disfmarker> because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic and and he's coming <disfmarker> you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . No , in no not only speech , yeah . Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this <gap> processor and <disfmarker> This really <gap> , Sho to to train , okay . Yeah . Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? <vocalsound> Like , if I want to put volume up I like do <disfmarker> mm I take my remote control do like <disfmarker> something like Um uh uh this point we didn't consider roll 'em up or roll 'em down . Mm . <vocalsound> Very expensive , because it's it's very expensive And volume control . Yeah , even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it <disfmarker> different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off So but uh <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . <vocalsound> Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I <disfmarker> Hmm .
Mm . Clap clap clap it's a good <disfmarker> You can clap . Can you ? Yeah . <vocalsound> These are not our target people . <vocalsound> Mm uh okay . But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break . Mm great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um <vocalsound> we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um <disfmarker> on the components so <vocalsound> uh you will focus on the component concept um Yeah yeah . uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept Mark will <disfmarker> and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So <vocalsound> um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to <disfmarker> we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? <vocalsound> Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . Uh it's in current price , yeah . maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible . Yeah , implemented . do you see something else ? No . Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? <vocalsound> Speakers in the remote cont Like , you want to find it , you shout Oh yeah . Uh yeah that's <disfmarker> and it answers is I'm here ? Or <disfmarker> It just beeps . That would be enough . Just beeps ? Or maybe you want to phone him . Something very cheap . But that's ex that's expensive . Uh . Yeah yeah yeah . Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them And uh <disfmarker> and and they <disfmarker> And it's answered . because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . Yeah .
and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um <disfmarker> on the components so <vocalsound> uh you will focus on the component concept um Yeah yeah .
Mark will <disfmarker> you will focus on the component concept um Yeah yeah . uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
Mark will <disfmarker> and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So <vocalsound> um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to <disfmarker> we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? <vocalsound>
Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to <disfmarker> we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? <vocalsound> All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment Mm . Yeah and it <disfmarker> mm . and then maybe m make it more generalised <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , okay .
And we have um maybe we have to <disfmarker> we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? And volume control . even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it <disfmarker> different criteria for different people Yeah , <vocalsound> Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . Uh it's in current price , yeah .
So basically that's it . <vocalsound> Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . Can be easily done , Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment Mm . Yeah and it <disfmarker> mm . and then maybe m make it more generalised <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , okay .
t because <disfmarker> So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , So for instance if I want to go to <disfmarker> directly to channel twenty five , how would I do <disfmarker> can I do that with this ? Uh twenty five . Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . Yeah . <vocalsound> In fact I would propose another solution . Or is it ? Basically you use just four or five channels , Most people <disfmarker> Go to channel twenty five . and then it go One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .
Mm-hmm . so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Mm . No , even in <disfmarker> you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and we want to make really simple device Cheap . because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like Mm-hmm . and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .

Ye yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words Okay . Couple of words . and and because we can't really say user to say same wording Mm-hmm mm .
Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . <vocalsound> even in <disfmarker> you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , Okay .
Mm . Clap clap clap it's a good <disfmarker> You can clap . Can you ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Speakers in the remote cont Like , you want to find it , you shout Oh yeah . Uh yeah that's <disfmarker> and it answers is I'm here ? Or <disfmarker> It just beeps . That would be enough . Just beeps ? Or maybe you want to phone him . Something very cheap . But that's ex that's expensive . Uh . Yeah yeah yeah . Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them And uh <disfmarker> and and they <disfmarker> And it's answered . because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . Yeah .
<vocalsound> So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <gap> . <vocalsound> So let's see the <disfmarker> what did you prepare . Yeah , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> S so so I discussed with Guillaume . Mm . Right . <vocalsound> And uh <vocalsound> so we have <vocalsound> <disfmarker> and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or <gap> control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . <vocalsound> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <vocalsound> . So <vocalsound> . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . How much does it cost this one ? Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars For the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh <disfmarker> Ah it's above it's above the budget . yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh <disfmarker> voila . The cost would be le reduced . Yeah the <gap> and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . <gap> Mm .
And uh <vocalsound> so we have <vocalsound> <disfmarker> and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . Mm . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . Mm . Mm-hmm . You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <vocalsound> for the speech recognition system here . <vocalsound> And here the the switch that control if you want <disfmarker> Why you why you you put it in the the side ? No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . Yeah . Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? Well so it's a microphone array . <vocalsound> Oh it's very costly , microphone array <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> No it's just a single microphone , Yeah <vocalsound> and you <disfmarker> I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . Yeah <vocalsound> yeah . Okay . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . How much does it cost this one ? Mm . Hmm . How many b battery is there ? How many , excuse me ? Battery . Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh <disfmarker> Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . Yeah . A_A_ rechargeable batteries . Rechargeable of course , So one one battery ? On uh yeah one battery . Is that two or one ? <vocalsound> It's kinetic reserve . <vocalsound> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah <vocalsound> . So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger Yeah . Yeah . and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Mm . <vocalsound> it works <vocalsound> . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . b this button <disfmarker> yeah alright . This button is like the mouse <disfmarker> is like a joystick , <vocalsound> you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it <disfmarker> the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button <vocalsound> . Mm . <vocalsound> You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Yeah . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> So basically th it's the same uh <disfmarker> Uh-huh and also the switch . <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . Mm . <vocalsound> So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No four dollars , it's <vocalsound> <gap> good . <gap> And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , Oh no Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ? So <disfmarker> W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . Th they <vocalsound> either these with the <disfmarker> uh the the charger any With the remote control . in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . Okay Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And so mm-hmm . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Titanium . Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Yeah that's fine . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ <vocalsound> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the <disfmarker> or is it <disfmarker> Yeah and um <disfmarker> And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define Mm hmm hmm hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a <gap> of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night .
You want a microphone to put in the <vocalsound> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <vocalsound> . Okay . So <disfmarker> Hmm okay . It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <vocalsound> . <gap> and they can have all the control they want here . Mm . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , Hmm . <vocalsound> and it acts like the previous one , Yeah . you just plug in and it works . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with <vocalsound> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here <disfmarker> oop <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it's very robust <gap> , it doesn't break Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , <gap> for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it <disfmarker> put it back in , or you can use the other one , Yeah . <vocalsound> or <vocalsound> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . <vocalsound>
It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <vocalsound> . <gap> You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control But <disfmarker> you should present that . And this is other one ? that that you ca you can add up <vocalsound> to the <disfmarker> to your remote control <vocalsound> i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . <vocalsound> Yeah . H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up <disfmarker> they come up with their modules , Mm hmm hmm hmm . it's very robust <gap> , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? The titanium and so it's very uh <disfmarker>
Mm-hmm . And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ? <disfmarker> uh this is the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well so the price to produce <disfmarker> For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . Uh it's about it <disfmarker> With with with the charge ? The <disfmarker> without without the charger With the charger ? Okay . Yeah <vocalsound> it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . <vocalsound> Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ <vocalsound> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think we can use Excel <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> It's about <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We don't have all the options <vocalsound> . so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . Charger we don't have charger here either . No it's But it's just if you want all functionalities . it's below the the the budget . Yeah <vocalsound> .
Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . <vocalsound> So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is <disfmarker> first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . <vocalsound> And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . Mm . <vocalsound> Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use . Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself Mm . since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find <disfmarker> these are the latest fashion updates , and so this <disfmarker> in Paris and Milan <gap> they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . Spongy spongy . Mm mm . So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . Mm <vocalsound> mm . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . Okay . But the the problem is that uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> is it robust to mishandling ? We have <disfmarker> you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <vocalsound> . A sponge . <vocalsound> Yeah so uh <vocalsound> so finally we have these three criterias . Spongy <vocalsound> . One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . <vocalsound> So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . <gap> I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu Yeah .
And without L_C_D_ ? Both . Mm for both it's the the same innovations . For both . It's the same innovation . Okay . So maybe I can put six to seven . <gap> six , let's go for six . Both . No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I <disfmarker> there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y Yeah . then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . Mm . So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which <gap> do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , Yeah <vocalsound> and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product <vocalsound> so I will give a six for the easy to use . Yeah I think <disfmarker> sorry . No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , Yeah . Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch Yeah . <vocalsound> without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . Yep . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated Mm-hmm . because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the <gap> s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , Yeah yeah that's right . so that's why <vocalsound> we have the parental module . Uh we can ha have <disfmarker> build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um <disfmarker> we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . Yeah . so <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? Six . Or you want it to be six ? Um six . I think it's the same . and it's going to be much simpler to use . Mm . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , Hmm . say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , Mm-hmm . and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . Mm . So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , <vocalsound> so on this scale , if it is true , if it is <disfmarker> if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , Mm . or if it is false , it doesn't <disfmarker> it looks uh <disfmarker> it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So <disfmarker> But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? You . According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel <disfmarker> does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? Mm . Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look <disfmarker> how does it look ? Mm . Mm . D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . And you both agree for that ? And you ? <vocalsound> I think we can improve on the design . <vocalsound> Yeah . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh <gap> <vocalsound> design . It's it it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we have been focused all all this <vocalsound> time on the <vocalsound> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . Technical aspects . Mm-hmm . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help <vocalsound> . So I take three on <disfmarker> with L_C_D_ ? Yeah a three . So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? Yeah <vocalsound> . Uh four . Four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . Well it's it's the same for both so <vocalsound> I will give a five , six . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Norman please . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <vocalsound> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now <disfmarker> and another innovation we have is simplicity and <disfmarker> simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A lot of functionalities . With lot of functionalities . So without L_C_D_ ? So that is uh that is uh for both th
Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so Yeah . so let's go back to our laboratory and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To improve on the design . So .
Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so Yeah . so let's go back to our laboratory and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To improve on the design . So . What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? Huh ? <gap> what about the integration of speech recognition ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Yeah . Right ? That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . Yes as you say , with better uh <vocalsound> Without L_C_D_ . S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . <disfmarker> yeah . And to improve the the look . As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , Yeah .
I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module Yeah . Or ma yeah . and so that their parents can't use it <vocalsound> . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , <gap> <vocalsound> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children Yeah . <disfmarker> <vocalsound> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , what do you think uh ? So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional <disfmarker> uh will be optional . Yes exa So based on that I think <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <vocalsound> I think it inc increase . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but <disfmarker> Hmm . it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <vocalsound> functionalities um on the same module , but uh <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . yeah yeah . Well well the other aspect is that if <vocalsound> in the <disfmarker> when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the <disfmarker> you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional <gap> . Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . <vocalsound> We make updates and sell it <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be <disfmarker> can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? <vocalsound> Yeah .
in what material would that be in uh ? Sponge . <vocalsound> I think you need to look into the material . Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah , it depends on the v production . <vocalsound> And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? Well so <disfmarker> yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um <disfmarker> but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so <disfmarker> Mm . Or uh it could be like this <disfmarker> the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . Mm . Uh well but it's a bit complicated to <disfmarker> if if if you need machines to <disfmarker> different machines to um ah well <disfmarker> Yeah . What we can change is to propose the <vocalsound> customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin Yeah , yeah that's right . and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape Yeah . and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . Yeah .
I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . <gap> Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Project evaluation . <gap> <vocalsound> Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but I think it's okay for us to work with . <vocalsound> I feel it's fine , <vocalsound> Yeah mm . That was good . This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . Mm .
<vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And the leadership was excellent . <vocalsound> Yeah I think so <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah that's right . Uh the teamwork was very very good . Very democratic . Alright . Alright . And new ideas found . Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come up with new product <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I mean uh what type of product would you think <disfmarker> could we make this more interesting ? <vocalsound> Less fancy . Mm we <disfmarker> I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <vocalsound> Yeah and also more well uh <vocalsound> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . We achieved uh project goal I think . Yeah that is within the budget . De Mm . <vocalsound> yes , more or less . And the evaluation was <disfmarker> Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . Yeah that's right . Yeah thank you for your work and <disfmarker> Yeah thank you , thank you very much .
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . Yeah . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or <gap> control module . A_A_ rechargeable batteries . Rechargeable of course , Battery . Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh <disfmarker>
It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <vocalsound> . <gap> You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control But <disfmarker> i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . <vocalsound> Yeah . H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up <disfmarker> they come up with their modules , Mm hmm hmm hmm . and they can have all the control they want here . Mm . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , Hmm .
but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ <vocalsound> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the <disfmarker> or is it <disfmarker>
Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it <disfmarker> put it back in , or you can use the other one , Yeah .
Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so Yeah . so let's go back to our laboratory and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To improve on the design . So .
What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? Huh ? <gap> what about the integration of speech recognition ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Yeah . Right ? That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . Yes as you say , with better uh <vocalsound> Without L_C_D_ . S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . <disfmarker> yeah . And to improve the the look . As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , Yeah .
<vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And the leadership was excellent . <vocalsound> but I think it's alright . Yeah that's right . Uh the teamwork was very very good . Very democratic . Mm we <disfmarker> I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <vocalsound> Yeah and also more well uh <vocalsound> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
So we can't go <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Talk about <disfmarker> We haven't really uh determined <vocalsound> what are <disfmarker> actually actually I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design <disfmarker> No it's like this , <vocalsound> I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . So let's remove it . Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . But <disfmarker> This is the problem . No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . If you have the L_C_D_ , L_C_D_ ? but if n Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Yeah . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . I mean that depends upon your design , so <disfmarker> Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ <vocalsound> we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , I mean <disfmarker>
Four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we have been focused all all this <vocalsound> time on the <vocalsound> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . Technical aspects . Uh four .
Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so Yeah . so let's go back to our laboratory and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To improve on the design . So .
in what material would that be in uh ? Sponge . <vocalsound> I think you need to look into the material . Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah , it depends on the v production . <vocalsound> And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? Well so <disfmarker> yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um <disfmarker> but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so <disfmarker> Uh well but it's a bit complicated to <disfmarker> if if if you need machines to <disfmarker> different machines to um ah well <disfmarker> Yeah . What we can change is to propose the <vocalsound> customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin
but I think it's alright . Mm we <disfmarker> I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <vocalsound> Yeah and also more well uh <vocalsound> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
That's as far as it goes <vocalsound> . Hi guys uh good morning everybody here . And uh I want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . And what you're uh drawing ? <vocalsound> Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user <disfmarker> usability user interface designer . <vocalsound> My name is Ed and I do accounting . Uh how you spell your name uh ? Mm . And ? Do you also do marketing ? <vocalsound> No <vocalsound> . So only accounting ? Accounting , yes . Okay . And ? And I'm Christine , Mm-hmm . and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer . Industrial designer . But I'm not really one . So who is uh marketing , nobody in the market Marketing is uh , is me <vocalsound> . It's you , okay .
Marketing is uh , is me <vocalsound> . It's you , okay . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from <disfmarker> with this . Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh for the moment not yet . Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what's what's your uh <disfmarker> do you have some project plan , something with you or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Good question <vocalsound> . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . We'll have to <disfmarker> simply we'll have to work on it together . Mm-hmm . Okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh <disfmarker> Certainly by the next meeting . By next meeting , okay that will be great . Uh Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? What is the goal of the project ?
Uh Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? What is the goal of the project ? Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , <vocalsound> so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . <vocalsound> Yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . Um I was wondering <disfmarker> Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . we'll start with the remote control for television then . So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , Mm-hmm . because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , Mm-hmm . 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . Mm-hmm .
If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . <vocalsound> And when would you like that ? <vocalsound> Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a <disfmarker> is close enough ? Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . Uh <vocalsound> are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , <vocalsound> Thank you . Okay . And uh Ed uh so what's <disfmarker> what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , Mm . And uh what abo uh Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , Mm-hmm . and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal . So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . Okay . Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? <vocalsound> Uh for the industrial design ? Yes . Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . <vocalsound> Okay . That's <gap> Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you have different choices with different financial models . Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . <vocalsound> Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive <disfmarker> that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . So it would <disfmarker> really would need to um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh Mm-hmm . you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . Okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? <vocalsound> Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go .
Hmm . uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh <disfmarker> the competition , Mm-hmm . uh th I agree it has to be something <disfmarker> it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , And uh Ed uh so what's <disfmarker> what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , <vocalsound>
Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , Yeah . so because you need to sell <disfmarker> and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . Mm-hmm . So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , Mm-hmm . and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the <disfmarker> your sales plan , okay , Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , th Th That <disfmarker> that's that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? <vocalsound> Yes , that's <disfmarker> you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you <disfmarker> uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . <vocalsound> Very good . Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . Okay , I can coordinate , Very good . or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ? Mm . Between uh all the coor Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . Yeah . So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , Th Christine , yeah <vocalsound> . Which will also feed into the marketing , Yes . because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . Um , and then because I think you need to take all the factors into account . Yep . But what I request , okay , <gap> keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening . Yeah , of course <vocalsound> . Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . Yes . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , Sure .
So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or Yes . <disfmarker> okay . Okay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , Mm-hmm . so then we can discuss about uh further things . Okay . Mm-hmm . Thanks for coming . Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? Yes , I will . Yes . Mm-hmm , le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? Sure . And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here .
Yes , that's <disfmarker> you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you <disfmarker> uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . <vocalsound> Very good .
<disfmarker> okay . Okay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,
Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . Yeah . Okay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm . Thanks for coming . Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? Yes , I will . Yes . Mm-hmm ,
Mm-hmm . so then we can discuss about uh further things . Okay . and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,
So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or Yes .
I thought we were designing a new monitor . Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal . So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . Okay . Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , <vocalsound> And uh Ed uh so what's <disfmarker> what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , Mm-hmm . and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control ,
and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details . Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh <disfmarker> <gap> Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique <vocalsound> to to store the energy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We also um <vocalsound> we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . <vocalsound> But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . Mm . <vocalsound> And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy Sorry . Yeah . What is this single curved <disfmarker> what does it mean ? Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . So it's it's not <disfmarker> You you will have the <disfmarker> well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the <disfmarker> Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um <disfmarker> That that's what it means by kinetic . <vocalsound> Yeah and by <disfmarker> well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . Okay .
Mm . <vocalsound> And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work <vocalsound> in a cluttered uh <vocalsound> uh environment . Mm . So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are <disfmarker> mm will be uh very happy to have a <vocalsound> a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip <vocalsound> that are uh well cheaper . <vocalsound>
But I d I don't know it's <disfmarker> if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <vocalsound> ready for market . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wha So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <vocalsound> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . Ah the department .
Yeah . <vocalsound> So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user <gap> and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh <disfmarker> we are more <disfmarker> we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . What's the function of this button . <gap> function five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . Yeah .
Yeah . So next line . So the <disfmarker> here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one . Yeah . So some people are propose voice recognition and so <disfmarker> ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine <vocalsound> for this by a company <vocalsound> when you tell the <disfmarker> you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . Mm-hmm mm mm . So I just got an email saying that . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . Yeah fine . <vocalsound> The next one . Mm so somebody <disfmarker> some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real <disfmarker> so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Yeah . Next one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . mm Mm-hmm . so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm <disfmarker> yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So <disfmarker> But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the <disfmarker> currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f <gap> customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . Yeah . So this guy <disfmarker> this is another company that provides big buttons . At <disfmarker> I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . Yeah . And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , <vocalsound> for example . <gap> We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? Is it possible ? Yeah Yeah . but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh <disfmarker> the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top <disfmarker> on the top up arrow <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if you <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . Yeah yeah . And here are <disfmarker> is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So <vocalsound> we have many concepts there Hmm . <vocalsound> but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . Yeah . And basically uh <disfmarker> Well I <vocalsound> I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities Yeah . but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote <gap> Mm-hmm . since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , Yeah . Mm . because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . Mm .
So you are display on the screen . On the T_V_ screen . On T_V_ T_V_ screen . So <disfmarker> on the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . So just you push the button Oh . So that eliminates all the complicated documentation <gap> , Yeah . okay . So wi But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . If the if <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No <vocalsound> In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . Uh yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In a marketing point of view . <vocalsound> Okay . And let us see what the market demands . Yeah . Mm . Okay . Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control <gap> and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . Yeah . That's a good idea . <vocalsound>
What what <gap> market <disfmarker> yes yes . <gap> So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could <disfmarker> which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yes . So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of <disfmarker> fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them <vocalsound> rather than watching the T_V_ . And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . Mm . Mm , the functionalities yeah . So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . <vocalsound> Yeah . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .
they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly ,
Yeah . So I th I I <vocalsound> well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh on the speech recognition if the technology is available I mean that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . Mm . so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . <vocalsound> Yeah . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . Oh . Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . Big screen . It's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm ? yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce <vocalsound> and it's not really <disfmarker> I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . Yeah . So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . Mm yeah . Mm . The thing <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We just <vocalsound> play around Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have <vocalsound> a big screen in front of you , s Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , Yeah . If you re-use the existing screen , we element <disfmarker> eliminate the L_C_D_ , instead of use the <disfmarker> yeah . after all the L_C_D_ just to display Hmm . and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , Yeah .
Is i if i Yeah . And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . And <disfmarker> Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . Mm . It's for <disfmarker> Yeah . Ask our R_ and D_ department . it's just for small vocabulary . Yeah . Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , We <disfmarker> it's not <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . say eighty commands or so . And ho Yeah . Yeah okay . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . <vocalsound> Yeah . Push push <gap> . Mm , the scroll button , <gap> from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Yeah . Yeah I think that <disfmarker> Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or <vocalsound> help button . Yeah . Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button Don't use the buttons . so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . Yeah .
Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . A and <disfmarker> And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find Mm . and <vocalsound> when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t Where <gap> , You will listen to a peep , <vocalsound> special peep . yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . Or it could be also something like this , Yeah . Yeah . uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , Mm . Yeah . so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . Put it back at the charge . Put <disfmarker> Yeah . And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . Yeah . Mm . I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . Yeah . Hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I mean charger would be fixed You have to keep it <gap> . because it's always with electricity plugged . Yeah . That <disfmarker> we can <disfmarker> what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . Yeah . You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where <disfmarker> to the charger . It's an good reminder , Well the last one with the um <vocalsound> yeah with the two parts was uh <gap> original , so <disfmarker> With uh two two two parts controller . I mean <gap> uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and <vocalsound> use it , you can't avoid him . <vocalsound> Yeah . But you can have an button for child lock . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even <gap> <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Mm . Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . Mm . Yeah . Mm . That's right . Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just <disfmarker> yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically <gap> . So if he <gap> . I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think <disfmarker> So for mm <disfmarker> yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included . Yeah .
Mm . <vocalsound> I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser Yeah . because uh if you want <gap> uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , but if <gap> name the channel by by name <disfmarker> Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now Mm . and and uh <disfmarker> No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh <disfmarker> basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly <vocalsound> the screen the channel goes to twenty five . Yeah it's <disfmarker> yeah . So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers <disfmarker> That's right , yeah , yeah . Mm . Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent Yeah but well <disfmarker> Mm . okay . and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . Mm . Mm . So it's better to have some prefix <gap> before the number . But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . Yeah something , some code . Mm mm . Well I <disfmarker> That will be too big . And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . Or just <disfmarker> Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . <vocalsound> Uh ? It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . Because you have to s t uh a ch Well , it's convenient for the user . yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . Or maybe <disfmarker> Then <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> uh uh mm . Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , <vocalsound> Mm . just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . I I think that I have <disfmarker> mm mm <vocalsound> I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh <vocalsound> if <disfmarker> when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the <disfmarker> you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want Yeah , the <gap> . and then you go to that channel . So <disfmarker> Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train <disfmarker> you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . By associating each channel with the name or <disfmarker> I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . And for each one has his own . <vocalsound> A and in the same lines we would have a <disfmarker> one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name <disfmarker> bad uh reputation for our company . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm . So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , Mm .
Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <vocalsound> ready for market . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wha So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <vocalsound> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . Ah the department .
And <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah okay . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <vocalsound>
And also the cost for the speech recognition . Mm . It's for <disfmarker> Yeah . Ask our R_ and D_ department . it's just for small vocabulary . It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . Yeah .
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . If the if <disfmarker> But people are often enough looking at the help ,
<vocalsound> Uh ? It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . Because you have to s t uh a ch But I d I don't know it's <disfmarker> if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <vocalsound> ready for market . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wha So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <vocalsound> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . Ah the department . Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel .
And also the cost for the speech recognition . Mm . It's for <disfmarker> Yeah . Ask our R_ and D_ department . it's just for small vocabulary . Yeah . Yeah okay . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included . so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . <vocalsound> Yeah .
Yeah . So I th I I <vocalsound> well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh I mean that's <disfmarker> but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . Mm . so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . <vocalsound> We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . Big screen . and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . Mm . So if he <gap> . I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Yeah . And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I <disfmarker> Yeah . So for mm <disfmarker> yeah . You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , Yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included . Yeah .
Put <disfmarker> Yeah . And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . Yeah . You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where <disfmarker> to the charger . It's an good reminder , Yeah . Mm . That's right . Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just <disfmarker> yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically So if he <gap> . I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think <disfmarker> So for mm <disfmarker> yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included . Yeah .
So if he <gap> . I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think <disfmarker> So for mm <disfmarker> yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . Mm .
Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision .
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . Hmm . Hmm . Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . <vocalsound> From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , <vocalsound> I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . Okay . <vocalsound> Oh okay , that's fine . Turn . Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you <disfmarker> present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . Hmm . Hmm . Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .

So , <vocalsound> I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . Okay . Could you please show the presentation number three . Mm-hmm . I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . <vocalsound> Um . Number ?
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . Okay . <gap> Okay . So I am going to talk about <disfmarker> a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um <vocalsound> generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be <disfmarker> we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . <vocalsound> Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can <disfmarker> which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . Exactly . And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy ,
but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um <vocalsound> generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control .
Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just <disfmarker> Inch . Yeah , seven seven inch T_ <disfmarker> T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power . So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh <disfmarker> And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here .
Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just <disfmarker> Inch . Yeah , seven seven inch T_ <disfmarker> T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh <disfmarker> And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . Um I have to check what I wanted to <disfmarker> Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . <vocalsound> A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Yep . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes <disfmarker> if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , Okay .
Yeah , peeling of the banana . It would be cool , yeah . <vocalsound> Peeling of the banana , you know , Yeah . should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . <vocalsound> Yeah . w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , Yeah . Yeah . Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover Mm . Yeah or a <disfmarker> Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh <vocalsound> materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . Okay . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . Okay . And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or <disfmarker> Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . so it will be perfect . Mm . So we add also the speech recognition device . Yeah . Uh , so I think we have a lot <disfmarker> We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Not <disfmarker> J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , Okay . so no problem in energy , I think . So <disfmarker> You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven <disfmarker> not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's <disfmarker> that's my opinion . It's easier . Could you re could you redesign your board ? Five to ten . Well <disfmarker> But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . Oh . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . Mm . Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . Okay . but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . Yeah . So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . So <disfmarker> you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the <disfmarker> it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and <disfmarker> Seven to ten banana . Rather mango or something or . Um . <vocalsound> Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . Yeah . I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that . I think this <gap> is not good . <vocalsound> The screen has to be <vocalsound> square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . It could . <vocalsound> But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . Well <disfmarker> I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . Okay <disfmarker> Like modified banana , okay . Well it <disfmarker> we'll stick to banana , or ? So we are agree with the banana thing ? Okay . Okay . Mm-mm . So , <gap> the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . Yeah , I think infra-red .
And think we are on a good way . So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .
So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . Okay .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh , yeah , I uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh more about the shape and so on
So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . So <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . Oh . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible .
but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . Yeah .
Like modified banana , okay . Well it <disfmarker> we'll stick to banana , or ? So we are agree with the banana thing ? Okay .
Okay . Mm-mm . So , <gap> the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . Yeah , I think infra-red .
Not <disfmarker> J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , Okay . Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , Yeah .
<vocalsound> Peeling of the banana , you know , Yeah . should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , Yeah .
so it will be perfect . Mm . So we add also the speech recognition device . Yeah .
This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , Yeah ? how big is it in reality ? Well , seven to seven inches . Okay , so <disfmarker> So so for the same price we have four screens now <vocalsound> . That's quite big . <vocalsound> Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? Yeah but <disfmarker> Mm . Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . But I mean even even that is like this big . but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it . You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . <vocalsound>
So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? S
Could you re could you redesign your board ? Five to ten . So , what's the size of the device ? Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still <disfmarker> Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . Is it <disfmarker> I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . So uh seven <disfmarker> not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's <disfmarker> that's my opinion . It's easier . Mm . Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . Okay . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . Yes .
Yeah . w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . Yeah . Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the <disfmarker> it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and <disfmarker> Seven to ten banana . Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , Rather mango or something or . Um . <vocalsound> Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .
<vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . Well <disfmarker> I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . Okay <disfmarker> I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that . I think this <gap> is not good . <vocalsound> The screen has to be <vocalsound> square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . It could . <vocalsound> But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
Yeah . Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . Yeah , peeling of the banana . It would be cool , yeah . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover <vocalsound> Peeling of the banana , you know , Yeah . should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . <vocalsound> Yeah . w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea ,
I think so . Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves Yeah , that's a good plan . and everybody's name and what your function is ? So maybe we start with you ? Okay . Yeah , my name is Francina . And I'm uh an user interface <disfmarker> my role is uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . And I'm a marketing person . I wanna figure out how to sell them . Mm-hmm . And your name is ? My name is Eileen . Okay . Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the <vocalsound> technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation <vocalsound> to see what we really are supposed to do .
So maybe we start with you ? Okay . Yeah , my name is Francina . And I'm uh an user interface <disfmarker> my role is uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . And I'm a marketing person . I wanna figure out how to sell them . Mm-hmm . And your name is ? My name is Eileen . Okay . Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the <vocalsound> technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation <vocalsound> to see what we really are supposed to do .
Um . Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original <vocalsound> , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm . All right . <vocalsound> Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . Detailed design , same thing basically . Mm 'kay so <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Yeah , okay . All right ? Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . You wanna go Eileen and <disfmarker> Okay , I'll see what I can do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And remember you have to press so it works . So that it will record okay .
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> the market range unlimited meaning international Okay . and the production cost should not exceed <disfmarker> hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . Yes . And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing .
And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . Mm-hmm . Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Small , right . Mm-hmm . those which we get here nowadays it's very long . Mm-hmm .
Maybe it should <disfmarker> different colours or materials or you know . I do yeah , colours <vocalsound> We certainly can try to <disfmarker> I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . It should be something new <disfmarker> it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . That's right . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . Yeah . Yeah , design should be , yeah <disfmarker> it should be different . All the <disfmarker> almost all the remotes <disfmarker> Yes , exactly .
Mm 'kay . Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Exactly , I mean just <vocalsound> that's what I'm saying . Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . Yeah . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , Yes . So some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah , some beep or something like that , You know there would be <vocalsound> <disfmarker> right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off ,
<disfmarker> uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ <disfmarker> uh who is this ? The industrial designer <disfmarker> That's you . Yeah . Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . Then <disfmarker> And then the technical funct you are the technical function , Yeah , functional design , so so you are the working design . and you <disfmarker> So you have a working design and then a functional design . Okay . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . I think <disfmarker> basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh <disfmarker> Yeah , so let's see . Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . Yes .
Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . Then <disfmarker> <disfmarker> uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ <disfmarker> uh who is this ? The industrial designer <disfmarker> That's you . Yeah .
And then the technical funct you are the technical function , Yeah , functional design , so so you are the working design . and you <disfmarker> So you have a working design and then a functional design . Okay .
So you have a working design and then a functional design . Okay . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea .
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing .
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , Mm-hmm . uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing .
And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . Mm-hmm . All the <disfmarker> almost all the remotes <disfmarker> Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . Yeah . Yeah , design should be , yeah <disfmarker> it should be different . Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Small , right . Mm-hmm . those which we get here nowadays it's very long . Mm-hmm .
Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . Yeah . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , Yes . So some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah , some beep or something like that ,
And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Exactly . <vocalsound> At um twelve fifty Euros per <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well . Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . Yeah .
So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh . Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . Uh so we will see our three presentations . Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . Okay , Okay . Oh , maybe . Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Oh , you can put it here . and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most <disfmarker> by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came <disfmarker> they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . <vocalsound> So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um <vocalsound> they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control ,
Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas um <vocalsound> the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , Um and then thirdly , they <disfmarker> some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . <vocalsound> We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the <disfmarker> on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . <vocalsound>
Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . Okay , <vocalsound> uh about <disfmarker> what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to <disfmarker> for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . You still want me the presentation . and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with <disfmarker> uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation . I have a question . Uh-huh . Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same <disfmarker> have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it Okay . A kind of identification <gap> ,
It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition <disfmarker> well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , <vocalsound> less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . Yeah . But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the <disfmarker> what does it offer , you know . Mm . Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . So , maybe you can talk about the function , and <disfmarker> Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had <disfmarker> I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication <disfmarker> for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , Mm-hmm . Hmm . but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe .
It's just how to a Yeah . <vocalsound> We should hide them somewhere . Hide them , okay . Uh , okay , what else ? Um . I mean a power button's obviously <gap> Yes . uh required . <vocalsound> This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally <disfmarker> Because it's not a very current useful function . Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . No , I think it's after after five minutes or something <gap> a timer <disfmarker> Um , you know , it was nine out of ten Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , re relevance . <vocalsound> Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be <disfmarker> For what ? Uh power button . I think a button . A button is better . I think it should be a bu Mm . S What about things like the clock and um timers ? Do we still have the time ? If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? Mm . This is the question . Probably not . Is it useful ? Yes . It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want <disfmarker> The simpler it's is better . Okay , thank you Peter . 'Kay . So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um Mm . Uh apparently it becomes from <disfmarker> according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh <disfmarker> Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um . So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it <disfmarker> it makes it's too complex I agree . <vocalsound> The third <vocalsound> the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh <disfmarker> The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's <disfmarker> That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of <disfmarker> in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So , um <disfmarker> So now we we should take the decision what we are going to <disfmarker> what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? Uh . Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . And then we can move on to the more advanced features . Yeah . I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . Yeah . So , yeah . Yeah , okay . So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . <gap> Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we <disfmarker> will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ? I think it would be a b <gap> Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . Mm . <gap> Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . Oh I don't know . Oh . Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and <disfmarker> You mean like hierarchical structure . And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . Okay . Like categorising channels . If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . Mm-hmm . I It just an idea . I don't know what you think about that but . So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you <disfmarker> To have some feedback . Yeah . so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . Okay . I mean there's always <disfmarker> we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of <disfmarker> under a slide or some
Uh apparently it becomes from <disfmarker> according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh <disfmarker> Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um .
So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it <disfmarker> it makes it's too complex
I agree . <vocalsound> The third <vocalsound> the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh <disfmarker> The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's <disfmarker> That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of <disfmarker> in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company .
I think it should be a bu <vocalsound> Anything else ? So we've got channel and volume . Um . Yeah . Uh power button . Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . I think a button . A button is better .
Um , you know , it was nine out of ten Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , re relevance .
It's just how to a Yeah . <vocalsound> We should hide them somewhere . Hide them , okay .
Mm . This is the question . Probably not . Is it useful ? Yes . It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want <disfmarker> The simpler it's is better .
<vocalsound> Yeah , it's true , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . Yeah . But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the <disfmarker> what does it offer , you know . Mm . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . If I could go there with this cable . You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same <disfmarker> have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? I have a question . Uh-huh . Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency .
Mm . It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this . Okay . It's a a price matter .
Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we <disfmarker> will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ? I think it would be a b <gap> Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . Mm . <gap>
I mean there's always <disfmarker> we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of <disfmarker> under a slide or some
Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally <disfmarker> I think it should be a bu Uh power button . Because it's not a very current useful function . Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . No , I think it's after after five minutes or something <gap> a timer <disfmarker> I think a button . A button is better . <vocalsound> Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be <disfmarker> For what ? <gap> Yes . uh required . <vocalsound> This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?
If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? Mm . This is the question . Probably not . Is it useful ? Yes . It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want <disfmarker> The simpler it's is better . Mm . S What about things like the clock and um timers ? Do we still have the time ?
If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?
So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of <disfmarker> detail design of the product of the remote control . Um <vocalsound> So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . <vocalsound> And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . Okay . Um . Good .
Which is <gap> <disfmarker> So final design . Final design . Okay so You can pull it out first , maybe . We've <disfmarker> well first first of all we made a an attractive <vocalsound> base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> bana sit <disfmarker> the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh <vocalsound> uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath <vocalsound> we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh <disfmarker> through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you <disfmarker> quickly rather th Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops . Yeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh <disfmarker> it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . Uh-huh . And we we do have one more functionality . If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . The T_V_ yeah . Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay . yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . Mm uh <disfmarker> I see . I see . Okay . Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> And this is the uh the infrared uh port . That's right . Excellent . So . And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . Calling . Yeah . Excellent . And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? Actually they do . So , what else ? And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . <vocalsound> Is it really weight ? Yeah , they're light . Okay . It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . <vocalsound> Yeah . Ok And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . <vocalsound> Uh you mean <disfmarker> okay . So <disfmarker> I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . Yeah , What do you mean ? Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? How long the <disfmarker> Mm . Mm-hmm . No eight or eight or ten hours of working . If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . Ah , okay . Yeah . And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is <disfmarker> was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . And uh that's it . Or can move between positions in the in the number . That's right . And what about people who want to use digits ? Yeah . Butto real buttons ? Wow . Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we have to go through now evaluations . Evalua yeah . Okay . I <vocalsound> I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . And each criteria is <vocalsound> will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is <disfmarker> or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . Why this strange factor of seven ? Because i it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven sorry . Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , Okay . Go ahead . <vocalsound> And that's the criteria I I found more useful . I think I sh I <vocalsound> I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? Mm-hmm . Sure .
Not telling that you are young . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , it's I . I would buy <disfmarker> Li li like a teenager for instance . Still I I'd say two . I don't think I <disfmarker> at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really . Uh yeah , crazy . So you say two . <vocalsound> Yeah . I say five . F I d I say five . . If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . Yeah that's two different question . If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look So ? What now ? What range ? S I stick to five . I go slightly up . So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . Um , zero . Well if <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . No uh let's say I'll put two . I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda <disfmarker> at home is pretty terrible . If it was <disfmarker> change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to It's for the T_V_ . but uh <disfmarker> 'cause it's really bad but uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'd say a three . <gap> <gap> You are romantic , really . Two three five two three fi and two . <vocalsound> So it's somewhere three point five I think . <vocalsound> I would say two . Yeah , the uh <disfmarker> So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a <disfmarker> out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . Yeah . handy . Handy . Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or <disfmarker> Yeah , it's fancy , according to me . Seven but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , six . Seven . Seven by me . S seven . No , wait . Yeah uh five . What do you say seven ? I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels Six . Yep . but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other six point five . Functional . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll give five . Four . I would say <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? Everything ar The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf . Yeah . I have to say four . Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Well it's not a universal remote . <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> Five . Five ? Four . Four . Four . Four . So four point two ? Just four . Four . <gap> four . <vocalsound> So four ? <vocalsound> Obviously there are some outliers so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay cool ? Cool device . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There I'll give it seven . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Which <disfmarker> For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . Yeah . Seven . I would say five . I'll say five . Mm-hmm . Plus six , Yeah . I say <disfmarker> I said seven . So it's six . well , twenty five twenty five Euro question . Of course I'll buy the <gap> banana . <gap> What do you what do you guys reckon ? <vocalsound> Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . <vocalsound> I'll say five . Well <disfmarker> I'll say five . Hmm . I find it quite cheap <vocalsound> actually . <vocalsound> I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in <disfmarker> Yeah , <vocalsound> It's more targeting U_K_ or <disfmarker> I don't know . Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Why ? <gap> <vocalsound> I don't want a banana on my <vocalsound> living room table , a banana remote . <vocalsound> No but it's really handy actually if you see . <vocalsound> It's kitsch . Anyb anybody who comes here <vocalsound> <disfmarker> anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana . Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh
<vocalsound> Okay , <gap> now now we have to mm to estimate <vocalsound> uh the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five . So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . Okay so we we stick to battery , one . Yeah . No kinetic also . I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . Okay . No <disfmarker> so we hin And we have sample speaker . Yeah so one . Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . Well actually that that <disfmarker> no that sample speaker is not <disfmarker> we we're not using that , So we are <disfmarker> we're just using the the very beep <disfmarker> simple beep , The beep . because it cost nothing . <vocalsound> Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of <vocalsound> plastic . <vocalsound> Yeah . And we have sev So don't we need a <disfmarker> Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . <vocalsound> Yeah . So <disfmarker> So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . Yeah maybe . That's right . <vocalsound> So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which <disfmarker> the cord and everything which'll go <disfmarker> Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff . That's right .
Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . Mm-hmm . Well we decided against the solar cells so <disfmarker> Oh yeah finally we say no . You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . Yeah . I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . Yeah .
We don't have any push buttons . No , we have two push buttons . We have three . No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . Huh . No no . We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . Ah okay , okay . Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . And <disfmarker> So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the <gap> . So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . Yeah . Yeah . So first thing which we should take care of is , Make it plastic instead of rubber . instead of rubber , let it be plastic . oka all right . Yeah . So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . Yeah . That's right . Well <gap> <disfmarker> no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber <disfmarker> No , it's too <disfmarker> no . <vocalsound> Too expensive . <gap> if you drop it ? Okay so I put rubber one . Okay so special colour , yellow . Yeah .
Yeah . You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . Okay . Okay so in <disfmarker> for the case um <vocalsound> I put single curved . Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay . <vocalsound> Well , wait a second ,
Should it be more like um like a status of of the <disfmarker> these meetings in fact . Yeah . Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity . Oh yeah it's really creative . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um <vocalsound> like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it . Mm-hmm . Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of Biased . pointless . So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation <vocalsound> in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . Might have to draw a face on it . Mm-hmm . So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . Yep . And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ Integrate . What else ? Well done . I think we we can go Okay . production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . Mm-hmm . <gap> Okay so thanks very much . Yep . Yeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to <disfmarker> through to project evaluation . <vocalsound> Would <disfmarker> yeah , would buy . Sorry ? No we have a product which none of us would buy . <vocalsound> Yeah because th th the evaluation project <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so um <vocalsound> project process . Exac <vocalsound> Well in fact I I did not know <vocalsound> I didn't know really what to say here . <vocalsound>
You can pull it out first , maybe . We've <disfmarker> well first first of all we made a an attractive <vocalsound> base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh Mm-hmm .
it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh <vocalsound> uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath <vocalsound> we have the uh the turbo button
once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . Mm uh <disfmarker> Additional button . What this button for ? This is a teletext button . Okay . Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay . yeah ,
I see . I see . Okay . Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> And this is the uh the infrared uh port . That's right . Excellent . So . And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . Calling .
Yeah , they're light . Okay . It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . <vocalsound> Yeah . Ok And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . <vocalsound>
We don't have any push buttons . No , we have two push buttons . We have three . No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .
Uh you mean <disfmarker> okay . So <disfmarker> I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . Yeah , Mm . Mm-hmm . No eight or eight or ten hours of working . If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . Ah , okay . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . Mm-hmm . Well we decided against the solar cells so <disfmarker> Oh yeah finally we say no . You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . Yeah . I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . Yeah .
So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the <gap> . So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . Yeah . Yeah . And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is <disfmarker> was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . And uh that's it .
Okay so in <disfmarker> for the case um <vocalsound> I put single curved . Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay . <vocalsound> Well , wait a second ,
Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . Mm-hmm . Well we decided against the solar cells so <disfmarker> Oh yeah finally we say no . And <disfmarker> You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . Yeah . I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . Yeah . but I thought you know <disfmarker> because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a <disfmarker> instead of a turbo button Yeah , but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . so <disfmarker> Yeah . You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . Okay . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the <gap> . So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . Yeah . Yeah . So first thing which we should take care of is , Make it plastic instead of rubber . instead of rubber , let it be plastic . Okay so in <disfmarker> for the case um <vocalsound> I put single curved . Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay . Yeah . And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is <disfmarker> was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . And uh that's it . <vocalsound> Well , wait a second ,
Mm . Okay . So first , <vocalsound> let's uh see the prototype . Yeah .
You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . Two . Is there <disfmarker> Ha . You mean we can change the colour uh of th That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . For the L_C_D_ . The scroll-wheel , okay . Yeah . One scroll wheel <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One L_C_D_ displayed . Okay . Yeah . And which <disfmarker> what is that ? That <disfmarker> It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . This is jog wheel . <vocalsound> So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this <vocalsound> jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . <vocalsound> Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . <vocalsound>
Okay . <vocalsound> And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <vocalsound> And for the <disfmarker> And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . Mm-hmm . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . <vocalsound> And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . Mm-hmm .
Mm . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh <vocalsound> the case . <vocalsound> Yeah . And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . <vocalsound> Are colourful . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Material , we want to stick to titanium . <vocalsound> So , what is it ? Titanium . T titanium ? <vocalsound> And you can have many colours on weekends . Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? <vocalsound> On the L_C_D_ ? The case is silver titanium , no ? It's a <disfmarker> it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .
Okay . Thanks . <vocalsound> Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the <vocalsound> financial criterium ? <vocalsound> Yeah , what's is really <disfmarker> what do you think , is it fancy ? <vocalsound> Uh , it's really <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we are at seventeen dot eight . Not special colours an interest in ? if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Two . Two . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology . Technology . Okay . <vocalsound> Let's go for one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Now we have to do the average . <vocalsound> Quite I think it's a <disfmarker> d I think it's a one for that , at least . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Colour and shape . Okay . I suggested three . Okay . <vocalsound> At least a one , yeah . Mm-mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Robustness , uh-huh . Uh , still we need to cha <vocalsound> Okay , two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So size and weight . Yeah , yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> Uh-oh . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , <vocalsound> Three , three , six , eight , eleven . It's two point one seven . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? It's um robust , yeah . Useful ? Useful . <vocalsound> Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> So , should be okay . mm . Up to three for that , Mm-mm . Oh . <vocalsound> Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To <disfmarker> so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . Two point one seven . That's nice .
We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy . Yeah , yeah . It's uh <disfmarker> Mm yeah , very much . Yes . Project evaluation , good . <vocalsound> Okay . Safe uh asse uh safe assessment . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . See mm how <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Are we a good team ? Mm . Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Mm . And uh <disfmarker> Is there enough room for creativity ? Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . M maybe not , huh ? Team-work , very strong , I would say . Yeah , <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Both its it's cool . <vocalsound> Mm-mm . I um uh I would say three . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , you d <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me . yeah . Maximum is maximum . Oh . Yeah , yeah . So , remove one of them . Yeah .
we only <disfmarker> it's like the hand dynamo , no ? Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay ,
<vocalsound> Well , if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ Sample speaker . and the speaker . Yeah . Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <vocalsound> Yeah . Advanced chip on print , right ? Mm-hmm . So , put minus one there , please . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm not sure if this is legal . <vocalsound> Mm . Uh , mm-mm . Oh yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target . <vocalsound> So think of what we can cut uh here . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> What do you think ? <vocalsound> That's location sensors . Strawberry sensors . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And what about the strawberries on the top ? <vocalsound> I'm not convince . <vocalsound> I think it's good . Okay . <vocalsound> And you can have many colours on weekends . Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? <vocalsound> On the L_C_D_ ? Let's imagine . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> And what about the strawberries on the top ? <vocalsound> I'm not convince . Yahoo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's good . Okay .
Not special colours an interest in ? Yeah . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .
<vocalsound> Well , Apparently . So what is <disfmarker> Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So think of what we can cut uh here . <vocalsound>
So we come again for the the second meeting . Mm-hmm . Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . <vocalsound> And <gap> take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . And we have <disfmarker> think I got a new project requirement . So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . So the popularity of the <disfmarker> since the popularity of the internet , Okay . and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . And of course we should have our image <gap> in the in the design . So , let's start with the the industrial designer . <vocalsound>
Because it's open you mean . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> F_ five . Slide show , view slide show , <gap> . Ah . And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the <disfmarker> our new remote control for television . <vocalsound> So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . <vocalsound> So uh mm I'm thin uh <vocalsound> I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible <vocalsound> things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box <vocalsound> would uh look look like . <vocalsound> And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . <vocalsound> And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh <disfmarker> So , wha what I think <vocalsound> for now <vocalsound> is <vocalsound> we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the <gap> . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the <vocalsound> the schema of the <vocalsound> o of the future uh remote controls <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . This <gap> . This <disfmarker> What is the other chip for ? The one on top . The one on top is for the um <disfmarker> well the functionali the functionalities <vocalsound> One is a communication . and the the th red um <disfmarker> sorry the green one is is to <disfmarker> well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to <gap> uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . For men .
Mm . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . Yeah . It's a good idea . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . Yeah . Mm . We just make a small charger Uh <disfmarker> mm . Y yeah , yeah . and put it <disfmarker> Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? That's a good idea . <vocalsound> Ma Also , but but <vocalsound> I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <vocalsound> control . Bu <vocalsound> Our remote , Yeah . we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for <vocalsound> for the functionalities which is easy to to t Mm . What is F_P_G_A_ ? It's field programmable uh something array . <vocalsound> Gateway arrays . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's a field programmable gateway arrays . So why's it <disfmarker> how is it different from the Bluetooth ? Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can <gap> pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . Yeah . Programme it . Yeah <gap> . Okay . And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> So this are the <disfmarker> they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice <disfmarker> No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . Okay . Or it's something like <disfmarker> isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . Is the is the software par <vocalsound> Mm . Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the <disfmarker> <gap> . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> And uh I I don't think it will need um <vocalsound> very uh much power to make it run , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So I'm working on the technical functions design . <gap> can you show the next slide . So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So <vocalsound> so I found on a webs on the internet <vocalsound> That's good . <vocalsound> and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . G <vocalsound> For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . So I found two very good prototypes for <vocalsound> for this interface from our competitors <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so can you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> This are usual functionality <gap> . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from <vocalsound> <gap> the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . Tasks . <vocalsound> This is the most competing prototypes I've found <vocalsound> . <vocalsound>
This is the most competing prototypes I've found <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> But then uh loo but then I found if you look at <disfmarker> you see on the left one there are too many buttons <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And they are small <gap> . Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with <vocalsound> the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number <vocalsound> Yeah . so it's very lousy . Of course . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So you <vocalsound> so you move to the next the next one . Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . Yeah .
so we don't want that . Yeah . <vocalsound> So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can <gap> the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end <disfmarker> in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some <disfmarker> to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the <vocalsound> on the remote controller , right ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then we <disfmarker> the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in <disfmarker> we may K_I_V_ . What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah , all the processing is done <disfmarker> the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> than the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we have to t So we should have specific T_V_ ? Yeah . Or ? We can use this . We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . <vocalsound> Yeah , we don't <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> are you just wondering what controller <disfmarker> okay . Yeah , I think so . Yeah , not the T_V_s . J j just the remote control . I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that Yeah . and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because <disfmarker> Okay .
N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . <vocalsound> Yes , that's a good idea , I think . Keep the navigation We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to <disfmarker> i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . Yeah . Mm . It's easy to build , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's right . it does not consume much power . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , that's all . <vocalsound> Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to <disfmarker> if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you <gap> can <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so <disfmarker> you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . <gap> . Mm-hmm hmm hmm . If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . <gap> but uh I I think i i <gap> if you if you want to to make uh <disfmarker> well a a big jump <vocalsound> <gap> but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , Yeah . Mm hmm hmm . Okay . well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or <disfmarker> Mm . So , Mm . <vocalsound> we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . Mm-hmm . But we'll see . <vocalsound> How the <gap> this remote ? Uh it's gonna be small . <vocalsound> Yeah , of course <vocalsound> small . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it <vocalsound> <gap> too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you just uh shout <disfmarker> y h just <disfmarker> it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . Yeah , <vocalsound> I dunno how bu <vocalsound> <gap> just <gap> give it a name and we call him . <vocalsound> And <gap> responds to you , and <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , Little bit more if it's with extra features . Yeah . Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think <disfmarker> Okay . I don't know . There is <gap> in the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . <vocalsound> Or they say movie name <disfmarker> or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . Mm . So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well <disfmarker> yes a microphone into the the remote control , so <disfmarker> Mm , I think <disfmarker> so it's not really a problem . Okay . What about lighting adaptive options ? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <vocalsound> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Participant four . So Harry . Okay , after having the inputs from <vocalsound> industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that <disfmarker> These are the findings which we got and <disfmarker> yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology <disfmarker> We already know that <disfmarker> as discussed earlier <disfmarker> Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts <vocalsound> I- <vocalsound> mm . But I think if you <gap> to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited <disfmarker> you have limited vocabulary <disfmarker> Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . Yeah . We just have the <disfmarker> And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons Mm . Yeah . so it's a good idea . <gap> it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim . Mm . And next one was the size of the remote control . Mm . It has to be of course a very slim and small one . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , Mm . But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility <gap> . <vocalsound> I mean we have to look for a trade-off . Mm . The features and the cost . Yeah . <vocalsound> I no <disfmarker> I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that <disfmarker> These are the findings which we got and <disfmarker> yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology <disfmarker> We already know that <disfmarker> as discussed earlier <disfmarker> Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts <vocalsound> I- <vocalsound> mm . But I think if you <gap> to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited <disfmarker> you have limited vocabulary <disfmarker> Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . Yeah . We just have the <disfmarker> And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons Mm . Yeah . so it's a good idea . <gap> it's not going to take much space also .

And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , Mm . But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility <gap> . <vocalsound> I mean we have to look for a trade-off . Mm . The features and the cost . Yeah . <vocalsound> I no <disfmarker> I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , Little bit more if it's with extra features . Yeah . Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think <disfmarker> Okay . I don't know . There is <gap> in the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . <vocalsound> Or they say movie name <disfmarker> or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . Mm . So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features .

Okay . What about lighting adaptive options ? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <vocalsound> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . So we have <disfmarker> I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . Mm-mm . <vocalsound> So any things to to discuss ? I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . Or any suggestions ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . Expensive . Price . Mm . And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . Mm . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . <vocalsound> Okay . If you are watching an foreign movie , you get <gap> subtitles sometimes . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . Mm . <gap> . And if I am a German then I would like to have the <disfmarker> my options in German . So , the remote <disfmarker> it should have some <disfmarker> it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . <vocalsound>
Function . That should be a good uh point . Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? I think we we can we <disfmarker> <gap> is the <gap> . Yes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <vocalsound> about a way to to access the internet via the television . Mm . Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a <disfmarker> w which will c which will come in a few years . We already have some <gap> . So if we already have it in our remote control <disfmarker> So you have to anticipate the the future ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to <disfmarker> well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a <disfmarker> yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <vocalsound> The functionality in the future . Alright . Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog .
Mm . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . Yeah . It's a good idea . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Mm . We just make a small charger Uh <disfmarker> mm .
What about lighting adaptive options ? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <vocalsound> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . So the popularity of the <disfmarker> since the popularity of the internet , Okay . and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Okay , that's all . <vocalsound> Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to <disfmarker> if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you <gap> can <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so <disfmarker> you choose by T_V_ program If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . <gap> but uh I I think i i <gap> if you if you want to to make uh <disfmarker> well a a big jump <vocalsound> <gap> but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , Yeah . Mm hmm hmm . Okay . well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or <disfmarker> Mm .
You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can <gap> the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end <disfmarker> in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some <disfmarker> to do some preprocessing . Mm . So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a <disfmarker> w which will c which will come in a few years . We already have some <gap> . So if we already have it in our remote control <disfmarker> So you have to anticipate the the future ? So we should have specific T_V_ ? Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to <disfmarker> well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a <disfmarker> yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <vocalsound> <gap> is the <gap> . Yes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <vocalsound> about a way to to access the internet via the television .
