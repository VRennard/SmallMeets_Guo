We are Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype .
Uh s Final design . <vocalsound> Basically in <gap> <disfmarker> what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . Mm-hmm . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow I like the menu .
that's what we had uh <disfmarker> We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . Mm-hmm .
that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh <disfmarker> for speak recognition anyway . So which <disfmarker> you see the <disfmarker> And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for <gap> <disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost ,
So just half a Euro for <gap> <disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , Hmm .
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Yeah .
everything cannot be for free . We didn't <disfmarker> I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because that was <disfmarker> I th or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . Oh . There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Hmm . Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what <disfmarker> if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .
So d Oh wait . Uh pen . One and a half . <vocalsound> Which is not an option . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Anyone ? And the next one <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . It's perfect . Even for deaf people , but <vocalsound> that's yo m Mm-hmm . mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . But I mean we tried , Yeah . so I think it <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> that deserves a one . Definitely . And it's and it's <disfmarker> There's <disfmarker> To <gap> . That's okay then . And the next one . How is that ? Uh w we had <disfmarker> we don't have an uh manual , Manual . yeah . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average . Mm-hmm . <gap> I <disfmarker> but okay . A three . Nah , it's not really <disfmarker> only an extra . With the more important functions on . Yeah . So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . Yeah . But it tells you or not ? Mm-hmm . You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . And I will uh make a new blank sheet <vocalsound> Yeah . So so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel <disfmarker> that's what I call trendy . <vocalsound> I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . it's just not affordable at the moment . But it's not a one . Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect ,
Yeah . Hmm . Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , It's a little less <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> we evaluate the product . <gap> <disfmarker> General project , what's i in <disfmarker> For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , Okay , that could be b . Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . Oh . But that's not for me to decide . Yeah , I know . Yeah . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , Yes .
Triple R_ it is . And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . The r triple R_ . Triple R_ ?
Yeah . So have to write my report now , I guess . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah , so
So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . Should I write the banana down or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , sure . I take f I will write that one in a Word uh document . Okay . Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? Yeah , sure . <vocalsound>
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Yeah . So just half a Euro for <gap> <disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , Hmm .
No . Yes . Okay , we're final on that . So <vocalsound> one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . <vocalsound> Oh . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Perhaps we should make m I agree . Yeah . I would say <disfmarker> I would agree with you on the colour ,
Triple R_ it is . And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . The r triple R_ . Triple R_ ?
So just half a Euro for <gap> <disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , Hmm .
What do we scrap . Well easy .
So <disfmarker> and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah have the <disfmarker> it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it <disfmarker> if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . You make it d orange or whatever you want . one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Perhaps we should make m Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . But uh the <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , But <disfmarker> Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um <vocalsound> the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change <gap> any colour you want .
It's uh something we have to decide on . I'd say lose the curve and the colour I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , and <disfmarker> So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover You can take plastic , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve . Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . We could take out a curve indeed . Could <disfmarker> we could take out the curve . Is that an option ?
To ensure the profit . That <disfmarker> that's th that's the order . because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . It was a big issue , but <disfmarker> So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? I'll just go back . We're just uh <disfmarker> we're the project team It <disfmarker> it's not <disfmarker> The p uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , Okay , The people want to pay for for it , I think those are basic col They want to <disfmarker> and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company so why why uh <vocalsound> do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? Yeah .
'cause it's <disfmarker> this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . I don't think it's possible really . But the <disfmarker> it must be clear then what <disfmarker> what what for we use it . But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your <disfmarker> uh with configuring your remote control for favourite <disfmarker> your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . Yeah . Yeah . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . I do admit that we d <vocalsound> did miss a little <disfmarker> or didn't sp didn't talk <gap> <disfmarker> talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , True . So <gap> <disfmarker> like I said , <vocalsound> changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . The scale . Mm-hmm . oh , yeah . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> <gap> the menus uh <disfmarker> What uh ? Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those . Well I thought it was I thought it was <disfmarker> I thought that people wanted previews on their <disfmarker> I'm not sure if that even possible ,
Yeah . Hmm . Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , It's a little less <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> So that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little <disfmarker> it's easier to share them .
Okay , that could be b . Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . Oh .
Yeah , I know . Yeah . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , Yes .
Yeah . Very nice . Okay let's get started . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . So , I don't . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I did my best . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , Not yet . then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
Your turn Niels . Alright . How to select the next or <disfmarker> The next <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> Colours were under format Here you go . Kangaroo . <vocalsound> Fox . A fox yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? Yeah sorry , <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> introduction and get acquainted and <disfmarker> Firefox . Cat . Aye . <vocalsound> It's a cat . It's a cat . then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Yeah . Uh well you know how to <disfmarker> the documents work . So <disfmarker> Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It misses the spot . <gap> pressure . I'm guessing a turtle . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It doesn't always work . Yes . No . Draw . Alright . Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . 'Kay . Okay ? Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain <disfmarker> Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . <vocalsound> Okay . Different pen widths , how do you do that ? <vocalsound> Uh with the format menu . Oh okay . And use different colours etcetera . <vocalsound> It's a giraffe . Yeah . Are you serious ? Giraffe's yellow . <vocalsound> Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh <disfmarker> Oh format . Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or Yeah . so y you must save it at the end and then <disfmarker> Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh <disfmarker> That's some spots . I'll show you . I in the file option menu . Yeah . In file menu .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Uh I'm taking notes . Um Okay . Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project . <vocalsound> Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach <disfmarker> uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . So we have to s Okay now it's time for some discussion .
<vocalsound> Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . Mm-hmm . Same I believe <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? Uh well from a marketing uh <vocalsound> perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Mm-hmm . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research <vocalsound> uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . Mm-hmm . I mean , what functions do they have . Mm . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? Yep . Yes . So we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um <vocalsound> and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , Okay . Okay . uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> yeah . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? No n not specifically . More to how to get them Okay . Great . we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . Mm-hmm . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah . I guess so . Yeah . Okay so the um <vocalsound> uh <gap> this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ? True . Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? Yep . <vocalsound> And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Yeah . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or <disfmarker>
Any more points to discuss ? Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . Mm-hmm . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . Mm-hmm . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh <vocalsound> according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . And that's basically all I have so far . Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . Yeah . So that's very common . Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the <disfmarker> to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control . Yeah . 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . Okay , yeah . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel Yeah . but you might wanna use teletext also . Yep . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . More to how to get them No ? <vocalsound> I got some uh requirements and <disfmarker> No okay . it has uh <gap> it has to be user-friendly . Yeah ? Yeah . Obviously . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh <disfmarker> yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh what do you mean by that ? Yeah . Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . Yeah . Okay um <disfmarker> Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work .
I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? Yeah . Because then we have a <disfmarker> After that we are going to the conceptual uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> We're just working the three phases . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare <disfmarker> uh I have to defend our design , Do we <disfmarker> I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> That is my question also because like new new functions <disfmarker> Well I think that is the user requirements part . Requirements . Yeah . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small <disfmarker> Yeah . True . Yeah . But but we need good communication about this stuff , Unit . I would first m So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . Yeah well
In the project uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . Okay . So we have a basic starting point Okay . and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . Yeah Yeah . Alright . it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't <gap> <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Th the least amount of functions possible Yeah . Yeah I understand . Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions Yeah and we can uh expand them . well You can always add a few <disfmarker> like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . Yeah . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . Hmm , And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . Yeah I I know what you mean , Okay . but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . S You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . Mm-hmm . Yeah records and stuff like that . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . Okay . No . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , You need additional <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . so I kind of need to know what we uh need . Yeah . Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here Yeah . and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .
Alright let's move on . Let's see what we got to do . Yeah . Yes . and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . Yeah .
Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? True .
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? Yep . Right ? Yeah ? Yep . <vocalsound> And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Yeah .
I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . I guess so . Yeah . Okay so the um <vocalsound> uh <gap> this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?
and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . Alright .
we have a financial aspect to this project . <vocalsound> Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach <disfmarker> uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros .
we have a financial aspect to this project . <vocalsound> Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach <disfmarker> uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
the aim is to reach <disfmarker> uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . So we have to s
Yeah . Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . Okay . Yeah I I know what you mean , Okay . but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . S Yeah I understand . Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions Yeah and we can uh expand them . well
it's now <disfmarker> Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . <vocalsound> It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um <vocalsound> then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .
Time , yeah . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , <vocalsound> which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . uh uh <disfmarker> we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .
So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my <disfmarker> in <gap> my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . Okay .
Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . <vocalsound> And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , there <disfmarker> it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .
good . personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . Okay . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . <vocalsound> Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , so uh
um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . Okay . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . <vocalsound> And what's the um <disfmarker> that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights . Mm yes .
it's <disfmarker> this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the <disfmarker> about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Mm .
Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh then they uh might , Mm-hmm . 'cause young people uh like new features . Mm yeah . Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple <disfmarker>
Yeah . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Yeah . I do not want a full uh <disfmarker> it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . Okay . Okay . Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits Mm-hmm . but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um <disfmarker> <disfmarker> yeah . Yes , yes . Dual channel watch . Yes . Yeah ? Great . so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So
Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , I will .
Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do .
Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um <vocalsound> the Interface Designer , um I would like to <disfmarker> the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . Interface <disfmarker> industrial .
I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . Well ,
Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . Yep .
um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . Okay . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . <vocalsound> And what's the um <disfmarker> that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights . Mm yes .
Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , <vocalsound> Hmm , true .
or can we have the lunch ? We can have the lunch . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So that's out of the question . Yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface Yeah . and <disfmarker> You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Yeah . Maybe it's more important to make the <disfmarker> make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . Yeah . Yes . because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w Yes , yes . Yeah . and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . Yeah . A younger uh <disfmarker> Huh . the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Yeah . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but um <disfmarker> yeah . Uh Ruud , did you get that ? Yeah , uh b uh most . Yeah . Okay , so we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yes ? Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function <disfmarker> uh the functions decided and um <vocalsound> uh our target audience . w we will s we all uh <disfmarker> Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . A bit of a split mode . Dual channel watch . Yes . Yeah . Okay , well um Yeah , that's that's <disfmarker> It's cased together , nothing more than that . <vocalsound> It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . Yeah . There are some exceptions , and it's a little more <disfmarker> a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . I'm not so sure . Yeah . Well , that's complicated , Yeah . but is that so relevant ? No , you're probably right . Yeah . Okay . Well you could only lit uh the buttons <disfmarker> the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . Yeah . Yeah . Or <disfmarker> and it still looks very fancy . Yeah . So I'm I'm <disfmarker> I do not agree <disfmarker> Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . Yeah . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Yeah . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . So maybe that's a possibility , <vocalsound> Um have a think about it . Yeah . Okay , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Yeah . But maybe when we uh <disfmarker> Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Mm . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Okay . that's interesting . Or a find <disfmarker> a finding function , Yeah . Yeah , It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Sound signal . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , Yes , but they're they're mass production . Yeah . They're very cheap . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Yeah . Yep . So <disfmarker> I don't think that's a big problem Okay . Yeah . Okay , so But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that <disfmarker> these kinds of things . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . I think that's what we decided . Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . the <disfmarker> Yeah . But uh th but we also thought that <disfmarker> we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . Yeah . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . It's the other way around , yeah . Yeah . And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . Yeah . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh <gap> . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , Yeah . so So that's not a good idea . Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , I will . Yeah . Yes . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights . Mm yes . Yeah . It will be an <disfmarker> a unique feature of our remote control . It's a different <disfmarker> Yeah . exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , Yeah . and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and <disfmarker> probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um <vocalsound> an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . Yeah . What should we choose in in design ? Yeah . Well , um Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . Uh well <disfmarker> yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . Yeah . Okay , so
Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .
Yes , yes . Yeah . just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . And <disfmarker> yeah , something like that . It's not really a stick , It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what <disfmarker> which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . but <disfmarker>
Yes . <disfmarker> yeah . Yes , yes . Dual channel watch .
that's w w what we concluded . Yeah . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Yeah . I do not want a full uh <disfmarker> it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . Okay . Okay . Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits Mm-hmm . but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um <disfmarker> It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights . Mm yes .
<vocalsound> Maybe , maybe not . Because it seems like a very <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . I'll have to find that out .
or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And what's the um <disfmarker> I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy
No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . Okay . For the same costs , Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , it's can be uh in our <disfmarker>
the technical uh <disfmarker> there <disfmarker> I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um Well , is there not something f something more easily <disfmarker> Well uh <disfmarker> I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the <disfmarker> their remote . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Mm . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Okay .
it's quite complicated . <vocalsound> And b Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . Well , <vocalsound> Another device is not a solution . Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , Usually <disfmarker>
uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . <gap> just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea . so we don't want that . But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Maybe we can <disfmarker>
because that's his <disfmarker> his field of expertise . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated Mm-hmm .
Yes , that's important . And and do we want um the ten digits ? The ten digits ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? But maybe when we uh <disfmarker> Because I don't think <disfmarker> but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . Okay , Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits Mm-hmm .
then there should be <disfmarker> should done <disfmarker> be done something specific with it . Well <disfmarker> You c <vocalsound> you can d make them very fancy And <disfmarker>
speech . Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . Yeah . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Yeah .
yeah . So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Yeah .
Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh <disfmarker> Profitable . We we <disfmarker> yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Yes . Yeah , profitable .
So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your <disfmarker> you two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is it . Well , thank you . Uh , now <disfmarker> It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The <vocalsound> the sides . Yes . And the rest is hard plastic . And uh <disfmarker> We uh we had some uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We had a new idea <vocalsound> that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . <vocalsound> And then it covers the <disfmarker> these buttons Okay . until here or something . Yes . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . Mm-hmm . So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break . Okay . And the buttons ? Uh , well uh <disfmarker> Big . <vocalsound> Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh <disfmarker> yeah , and the mute and the the other button . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> . Yeah . And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . Uh , yes . Yes , that's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very obvious . Up is channel up . <vocalsound> Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down . Yeah . Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ <gap> d <vocalsound> The R_R_ ? R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . Okay . Very good . <vocalsound> So , we have <disfmarker> That's on the rub rubber part . Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here . So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . Oh . So , that's it . That's prototype . Yeah ?
That's uh um <disfmarker> <gap> That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . Um , yeah . Well , we uh <disfmarker> uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Think I can <disfmarker> Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm . I'll get it . Oh , it's okay . Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item . What do you think ? Yeah , I think it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh <disfmarker> it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it <disfmarker> Um , I think I will give it a <disfmarker> yeah , yeah , yeah <gap> , a four . Hmm . I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . <vocalsound> What uh <disfmarker> not anoth uh , not a lot of uh <disfmarker> a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six . <gap> Yeah . Sorry , six . So now i I think you uh see it <gap> um its statement . And you <gap> true or false . Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah . Two . Sorry . 'Kay . Um , well <disfmarker> It's a one . <vocalsound> The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . Mm <disfmarker> Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that . So it's a <disfmarker> That's uh a six . Five . Mm , four . Yes , it's for the younger g group . Yeah , but it's it's <disfmarker> So it's uh half half of the people . So I think it's four . Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So <disfmarker> I mean , the colours are for young people , <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe version uh three point O_ uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> has other colours . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , okay . Mm . We put the fashion in electronics . That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um <disfmarker> Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . Yes . Two . Two . Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . Okay . Then make it th three . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . I give it a one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes , a one . I like it . Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . <vocalsound> Two or three ? Okay , two . Two . Two . Okay . So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to <vocalsound> uh this fashion , I <disfmarker> We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . One . <vocalsound> You ? One . <vocalsound> Me too . One . One . <vocalsound> Um , but <vocalsound> where where is the <gap> ? <vocalsound> Next , six . It does not get lost easily . So <disfmarker> Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Just a small thing . <vocalsound> No , we did not . Yeah , but uh <disfmarker> So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? Yeah . Ah . Yellow . I don't think so . <vocalsound> Not a not a normal shapes . So <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . No . It won't . A one ? <vocalsound> Yeah , o one . Yeah . Okay , a one . One . Next . Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . <gap> Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . Yeah me <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Me too . That was our target . Two . Two . Yeah . Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel . Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . I would say yes . So um <disfmarker> Well , let's also give this a two . T I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy <gap> trendy . Okay . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . Yeah . So I think s two is better . Yeah , okay . And um , then the last one I could think of , <gap> . uh it goes with the latest trends . No , it's new . Innovation . If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh <disfmarker> We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . Oh . So , I would <disfmarker> did not give this uh a one or two . I <disfmarker> We'll go for a three . I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . <gap> . Yes . Uh <disfmarker> But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . By nine . Two . Yeah . Um , uh okay . <vocalsound> Two . Yep . So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? One . One . And it's not really a s
Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , Two or three ? Okay , two . Two . Two . Okay . and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , <gap> . Yes . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . By nine . Two . Yeah . Um , uh okay . <vocalsound> Two . Yep . Uh , nah . Okay . So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> So , it's good . So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <vocalsound> Okay . So , yeah . Yeah . Two . Sorry . Yeah . Me too . That was our target . Two . Two . Yeah . Yes . Two . Two . Uh , I say uh a five .
And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . One . <vocalsound> You ? One . <vocalsound> Me too . One . One . <vocalsound> Um , but <vocalsound> where where is the <gap> ? Yep . Next please . Next . Finance . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh <disfmarker> I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . Mm-hmm . Cheapest there is . Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . Expensive . Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . Well , it's the most advanced . We have the simple , regular and advanced . Advanced . We have the adva advanced . Okay , a one . One . Next . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . <gap> we have half rubber , half plastic . Mm , yes . No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . Yeah . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? One . One . And it's not really a s Joystick uh thing . <gap> . Yeah , it's this one . <vocalsound> Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already <disfmarker> Uh , that's the <disfmarker> from the <disfmarker> for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . Mm , yeah . <vocalsound> We're not gonna make it . <vocalsound> Uh , no . It's too expensive . Yeah . <vocalsound> Wh So , we have to change something . What what are the costs ? <vocalsound> Fifteen Euros . Fifteen .
Yeah . <vocalsound> If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . And what if we use only one sort of um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> just only plastic or only rubber ? That's one Euro . One Euro discount . <vocalsound> So , I don't think that's good . Mm <disfmarker> I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If <disfmarker> Okay . I'll have a look . <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour <disfmarker> it's a normal colour , Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? No . Uh , no , no , no . Or it's then a regular ? Uh <disfmarker> Oh , wait wait wait . The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Yeah , regular chip . Is it a good design ? Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . Mm , yes . And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , you have to pay point two Euros . So , all the buttons has to <disfmarker> have to be the same colour . Yes . but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ? <vocalsound> <gap> still , he waited at the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very good . No . Fifteen . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . <gap> . We would have uh n A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . Oh , no , we <disfmarker> No , it's uh <disfmarker> Sorry ? Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? For a remote control . <vocalsound> What ? I've <disfmarker> For a remote control , I think it is . <vocalsound>
Very good . No . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well <disfmarker> About the project . process . Went good . Uh <disfmarker> I think uh the creativity uh <vocalsound> was good enough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um <disfmarker> Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . uh o only the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . <vocalsound> Nope . Okay . And you . Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um <disfmarker> Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . Mm-hmm . Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor <gap> and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . <vocalsound> No . So , it's good for the speed . No . We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? Yep . So , I think we're ready . Yeah . Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .
About the project . process . Went good . Uh <disfmarker> I think uh the creativity uh <vocalsound> was good enough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um <disfmarker> Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . uh o only the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . <vocalsound> Nope . Okay . And you . Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um <disfmarker> Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . Mm-hmm . Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor <gap> and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . <vocalsound> No . So , it's good for the speed . No . We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ?
So , I don't think that's good . Mm <disfmarker> I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If <disfmarker>
Yeah . <vocalsound> If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . For a remote control , I think it is . <vocalsound>
Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . Mm , yes . And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . Oh , no , we <disfmarker> Okay . I'll have a look . <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour <disfmarker> it's a normal colour ,
So , yeah . Yeah . Two . Sorry . You ? So , that's it . That's prototype . Yeah ? Now , the finance . <vocalsound> We don't know if it's <disfmarker> th it <disfmarker> if it's okay . We have <disfmarker> Sorry ? Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? Finance is um <disfmarker> Yeah it's <disfmarker> No , first uh <disfmarker> Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Okay . Sorry . That's uh um <disfmarker> <gap>
<vocalsound> We're not gonna make it . <vocalsound> Uh , no . It's too expensive . Yeah . <vocalsound> Wh So , we have to change something . What what are the costs ? <vocalsound> Fifteen Euros . Fifteen .
Yeah . <vocalsound> If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . And what if we use only one sort of um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> just only plastic or only rubber ? That's one Euro . One Euro discount . <vocalsound> So , I don't think that's good . Mm <disfmarker> I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If <disfmarker> Okay . I'll have a look . <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour <disfmarker> it's a normal colour , Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Yeah , regular chip . Is it a good design ? Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . Mm , yes . And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , you have to pay point two Euros . So , all the buttons has to <disfmarker> have to be the same colour . Yes . Fifteen . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . <gap> . We would have uh n A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . Oh , no , we <disfmarker> No , it's uh <disfmarker> Sorry ? Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? For a remote control . <vocalsound> What ? I've <disfmarker> For a remote control , I think it is . <vocalsound>
Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? No . Uh , no , no , no . Or it's then a regular ? Uh <disfmarker> Oh , wait wait wait . The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Yeah , regular chip .
Well , findings . Uh <disfmarker> Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,
that's interesting . It's quite interesting . <vocalsound> You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . Yeah , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . Yeah .
it shouldn't be too hard . It it <disfmarker> maybe it rubber or or <disfmarker> And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um <disfmarker> I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a <disfmarker> it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . <vocalsound> We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . Okay . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c
Well , um and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium .
<vocalsound> Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh <vocalsound> remote controls . <vocalsound> I'll come to that later . Okay . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um
Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um <disfmarker> Okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay . which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . <vocalsound> The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . And click it to muten the device . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um <vocalsound> uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently <disfmarker> Well ,
and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me .
Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ? Traditional batteries uh and solar . But can there be uh wor can they work together ?
more f more more decisions we made . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> A scroll-wheel . The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . Voice recognition , of course . Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . Yeah . oh , But but do we want the curved uh uh design , evalu And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot <disfmarker> um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . Yeah . So I think this is the best of two worlds . Okay . Okay . W start with the casing . The casing is curved , single-curved . Single-curved . So <vocalsound> it has an <disfmarker> it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . And the regular chip . I think uh it gives us the advantage of <disfmarker> And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yes , yes . but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . <gap> uh black and yellow . Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .
Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . Okay .
Yeah . I'll check it for you . Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . Yeah .
Yes . Mm-hmm . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .
that's interesting . It's quite interesting . <vocalsound> You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . Yeah , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . Yeah .
I think uh it gives us the advantage of <disfmarker> And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yes , yes . more f more more decisions we made . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> A scroll-wheel . The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .
So it it needs to be rubber . No the <disfmarker> oh , But but do we want the curved uh uh design , evalu And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot <disfmarker> um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . Yeah . So I think this is the best of two worlds . Okay . Okay . W start with the casing . The casing is curved , single-curved . Single-curved . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? Yeah , with colourful rubber . Yeah . Oh okay , sorry .
No . I don't think you need it . 'cause uh <gap> uh all <disfmarker> any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , <vocalsound> I like the scroll wheels uh idea . And uh skip <disfmarker> and skip the L_C_D_ part . Yeah . Okay . Uh well <disfmarker> uh Okay . d did we already decide on the display ? To <disfmarker> Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh <disfmarker> I I don't think either .
Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ? Traditional batteries uh and solar . But can there be uh wor can they work together ?
But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and <disfmarker> Well , you <disfmarker> you're sitting on a couch . <gap> the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a <disfmarker> in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,
I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . Well , A volume , okay . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
Okay . Okay . Okay , what about um <vocalsound> the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Yes . Because it it's of cour It's it's <disfmarker> uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . Yeah .
But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . Mm yeah . Uh I think our customers will go insane . Okay , okay . Okay . uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , Technology .
Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , Hmm . Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image Hmm . <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But <disfmarker>
And th the <disfmarker> they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too . Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . <vocalsound> Battery and solar , yeah . Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? Yeah , with colourful rubber . Uh I see what you mean . Yeah . So if you uh <disfmarker> You just move the problem . So maybe they can combine these two . Yeah . Well actually , What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . I mean <disfmarker> Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be
because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . <vocalsound> I know ,
Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? Yeah , maybe so . Yes , A a and the voice recognition as well , it's <disfmarker> th maybe you could uh could uh <disfmarker> Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um <gap> . <vocalsound>
It it most definitely is <disfmarker> it's very easy . Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
Okay , and uh the colouring ? Uh yellow with uh <gap> with with grey or black . grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ? Yes , rubber ? And the buttons ? <vocalsound> Plastic or rubber . <vocalsound> There are plastic or rubber .
Or not ? yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . You <disfmarker> Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
So um <disfmarker> yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . Okay . that's about it . the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um <disfmarker> The production costs . The costs are not under <disfmarker> Can I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um this is the <disfmarker> Twenty two . Yeah , Hmm .
Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , Mm-hmm . um by not using the voice recognition feature , Mm-hmm . it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . Yikes . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . Well
uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Although I think we <disfmarker> yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Hmm .
No , Well , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . let's let's <disfmarker> this product .
So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . No no no . okay . <vocalsound> The remote control offers enough features . <vocalsound> Well , just <vocalsound> give it a two . Okay . Does it <disfmarker> will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , and uh was it innovative ? <vocalsound> we did good . so it will be a two point five . But that's not possible to fill in , Yes , it is . so we have to round it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is it easy to find ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I have a veto . <vocalsound> Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the <disfmarker> for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . I'll give a two . So uh also a uh two ? I think uh it's a two . Yep . Is it easy to use ? I'm not sure . <vocalsound> I'm not sure . we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Yeah . Yeah , I agree . Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ? Yeah , I think so .
Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? <vocalsound> Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . Yeah . Nine divided by six . Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um <disfmarker> What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? the the the <disfmarker> well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too <disfmarker> the the choice of components was way too narrow . Less . I agree . You agree , okay . Uh leadership . Fantastic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> okay . Okay . I think we're a good team . I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh <gap> . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Yes . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . I it's not possible <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> The process was good . But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . Yeah .
Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . Okay . Oh ,
if you would <disfmarker> if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um <vocalsound> to make it <vocalsound> just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , Mm-hmm .
Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , Mm-hmm . um by not using the voice recognition feature , Mm-hmm .
So um <disfmarker> yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . Okay . that's about it . the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um <disfmarker> The production costs . The costs are not under <disfmarker> Can I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um this is the <disfmarker> Twenty two . Yeah , Hmm .
that's about it . the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um <disfmarker> The production costs . The costs are not under <disfmarker> Can I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um this is the <disfmarker> Twenty two . Yeah ,
<vocalsound> Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . But it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . Yes . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . And no added value . At all .
Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic Yeah . Maybe we could uh <disfmarker> we should go for straight and simple , Yeah . but that's not what uh has been asked . I know , I know .
Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . <vocalsound> it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . Yes .
Alright . Okay , let's go . So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . Um you are the <disfmarker>
Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . Um you are the <disfmarker> I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer . Okay . Hi I'm Guillermo <gap> . I'm the Marketing Expert . And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . Okay , very good .
uh and mainly first to uh <vocalsound> to make <disfmarker> to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .
Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . As usual we will follow the the project method um <vocalsound> that we are using in the <disfmarker> in our company .
So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . As usual we will follow the the project method um <vocalsound> that we are using in the <disfmarker> in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board
and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . So who want to start ? Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . Mister <gap> . Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . <vocalsound> Let's see . <vocalsound> Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um uh I think I have one in mind , so uh <disfmarker> You have one in mind ? <vocalsound> I'm gonna <vocalsound> <gap> about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . Guillermo you want to ? <vocalsound> 'kay <vocalsound> I dunno why , but <vocalsound> when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther <vocalsound> It's not very strong . Okay . So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about <disfmarker>
So <vocalsound> we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh and about <disfmarker> so about finances .
and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> which which would generate a profit of of um <vocalsound> fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .
So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . So we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so <gap> the work every every of you ha have t d to do . So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? Yeah . Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . Thanks for coming today .
Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so <gap> the work every every of you ha have t d to do . So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?
Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . Thanks for coming today . alright ? Yeah .
uh and mainly first to uh <vocalsound> to make <disfmarker> to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .
So <vocalsound> we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh and about <disfmarker> so about finances .
and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> which which would generate a profit of of um <vocalsound> fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market . So could I just ask one question , um
and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> which which would generate a profit of of um <vocalsound> fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .
And we should target the inter an international market . So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?
so let's go to it . So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? Should it be a universal one ? And uh etcetera .
Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to <disfmarker> a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's <disfmarker> if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually <disfmarker> you know , what people ar are willing to pay for <disfmarker>
yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it ,
so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to <disfmarker> let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . Okay . And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? because my computer crashed . Yeah yeah . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Hmm .
Uh um um beep to find your control , was <disfmarker> that was <gap> in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , That's like a button on your T_V_ ?
Mm . Remote , okay . so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere Yeah , I think it's a really good idea .
I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those
What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . Mm-hmm .
You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh <vocalsound> uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv
I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , <gap> <vocalsound> see how far we can go with it anyway , so Yeah . <disfmarker> And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently <vocalsound> black and yellow , Um we're targeting young people now , because our um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , Uh . which are <disfmarker> um the younger people were defined under forty . Yeah .
no , I didn't have that . and <disfmarker> Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? Mute . Do we hardly <disfmarker> I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . Is that used often ? Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Ah yeah . All it tells <gap> just <disfmarker> let's make make a new <disfmarker> Do we put it somewhere over here ? tick the new one . Yeah . So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , <vocalsound> Around uh not uh not at top at the <disfmarker> around the volume selection . Let's see that you <disfmarker> what would be handy . Uh . And a light uh <disfmarker> I think that the <vocalsound> the buttons should be <disfmarker> the channel buttons should be <vocalsound> uh on their own . Let's see people are accustomed to that , so they should be here . Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume <disfmarker> Think it's like this . <vocalsound> Volume . <vocalsound> Uh we have green now uh <disfmarker> what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit <disfmarker> that has it on on on the bottom . In the middle . Maybe in a circle for example , like we <disfmarker> like in this example . I think this is not good , Yes , but we do agree that we <vocalsound> keep this at the centre , because it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . because it's basically the most important function . I think the channel button should be in the centre . It's the most import yeah . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? Oh yeah , it's true .
draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker> just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , Yeah .
this two , channel up and down . Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every <disfmarker> I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea So <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> to have uh like sort of a <disfmarker> maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . Yeah , okay , <vocalsound>
So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah .
I'm not sure y <vocalsound> I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea .
And uh with different colours uh . So um <disfmarker> I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . I can draw out some ideas . Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker> I have another thing uh <disfmarker>
you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it <disfmarker> Could you post some <vocalsound> other essentials of what people want , exactly , I need it . so . Hmm . <vocalsound> yeah . I want some <disfmarker>
Mm . I think it's <disfmarker> L_C_D_ is better now . Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . Yeah . I'm not sure it's even possible , Hmm . I have to check that out , but maybe okay , make it <disfmarker> We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , I dunno .
But let's cut the meeting for now yes . One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Okay . Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . Uh okay .
Um we're targeting young people now , because our um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , Uh . which are <disfmarker> um the younger people were defined under forty . Yeah .
<gap> <vocalsound> see how far we can go with it anyway , so Yeah . <disfmarker> And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently <vocalsound> black and yellow ,
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Yeah , so we don't want <gap> we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . No draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker> so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger Wow .
Even more durable uh . So this is basically what I h had in mind in the <disfmarker> fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so Mm . Remote , okay . so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere Yeah , I think it's a really good idea .
I'm sorry , so . So . We could do that . Just a light on it Whoa . Mm . Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you <disfmarker> if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep . We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you <disfmarker> that some light lights up . I thought about for deaf people for example , What did I write down ? I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ That must be possible . I think it's easy to implement , Ja . we should go for that .
then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , If not <disfmarker>
I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could <disfmarker> For example , if your buttons are faded , after <disfmarker> I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Mm .
I have some ideas . I have some ideas . maybe the shape can be a little different . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . Um <disfmarker> yeah . Mm that's your uh division . <vocalsound> And uh with different colours uh . So um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it <disfmarker> even if you put a different cover on it , it looks <disfmarker> still looks boring , <vocalsound> Different colours maybe . so . Hmm . And the design , it should differ . But all <disfmarker>
draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker> just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , Yeah .
but then I know what to look for . Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . That sounds too <disfmarker> Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . That's almost undoable . Yeah . Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do .
Mm uh . Mm-hmm . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols ,
That is true . I don't think so . No , that's true . you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . Mm . Is it techni technically possible to uh <vocalsound> send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , <vocalsound>
that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , Mm . but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . But that might be broken . is it ? Um <disfmarker> Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . Yeah , but <disfmarker> If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . We need to adjust to the <vocalsound> technology . But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . I think so too . I think so too . True . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then uh <disfmarker> and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .
no , I didn't have that . and <disfmarker> Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? Mute . Do we hardly <disfmarker> I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . Is that used often ? Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Ah yeah . All it tells <gap> just <disfmarker> let's make make a new <disfmarker> Do we put it somewhere over here ? tick the new one . <vocalsound> Around uh not uh not at top at the <disfmarker> around the volume selection . Let's see that you <disfmarker> what would be handy . Uh . And a light uh <disfmarker> I think that the <vocalsound> the buttons should be <disfmarker> the channel buttons should be <vocalsound> uh on their own . Let's see people are accustomed to that , so they should be here . Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume <disfmarker> Think it's like this . <vocalsound> Volume . <vocalsound> Uh we have green now uh <disfmarker> what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit <disfmarker> that has it on on on the bottom . In the middle . Maybe in a circle for example , like we <disfmarker> like in this example . I think this is not good , Yes , but we do agree that we <vocalsound> keep this at the centre , because it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . because it's basically the most important function . I think the channel button should be in the centre . It's the most import yeah . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? Oh yeah , it's true .
this two , channel up and down . Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every <disfmarker> Yeah , that's g But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station <disfmarker> I'm not sure if it costs a lot , But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? Yeah . I'm not sure y <vocalsound> I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , that that's what he r okay , <vocalsound>
um so they can say uh what they want to <disfmarker> let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . Okay . And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? because my computer crashed . Yeah yeah . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Hmm . That's almost undoable . Yeah . Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
Yeah , but why I <disfmarker> I'm not sure . Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . Think it's a good place , people don't <disfmarker> If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . No ? Okay . Huh . So we have three people saying it should be on top . Okay ,
Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . <vocalsound> Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ? I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer . User interface , okay . Hi , my name's uh <gap> . I'm the Industrial Designer . Industrial , yes . I'm uh Tim <gap> . Um my function is the Marketing Expert . Okay ,
Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs . <vocalsound> Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . <vocalsound> Okay uh , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ?
Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> This uh is <gap> very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , So it's uh it's very straightforward . <vocalsound> Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . <vocalsound> This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh
Oh , it is a turtle . It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ? Um <disfmarker> 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . <vocalsound> Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . Yeah , exactly . <vocalsound> Okay , then yeah . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Miniature size ? So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . It's a dog . Well , You have a dog at home ? Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . Uh , it's p <vocalsound> Okay . Uh little uh little <vocalsound> kinda exercise to uh know each other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours , <vocalsound> and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . I have a question . yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . Ah .
It's pretty abstract . now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . <vocalsound> Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . Like how much ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ? Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . Oh yeah .
Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television .
Um <disfmarker> So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and <disfmarker> Or just only <disfmarker> I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . Yeah . Yeah . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . Mm-hmm . Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um <vocalsound> think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . Okay . Okay . That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um <disfmarker> And something like an L_C_D_ screen . For what purpose ? Um uh like I said here um <disfmarker> Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , <vocalsound> when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? Yeah , Yeah . Look , <vocalsound> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh <disfmarker> Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . No . But when you enter a new market with a remote control and Mm-hmm . uh wanna gain market share Yeah . you have to do something special , I think . Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's <disfmarker> Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh <disfmarker> Yeah , of course . And and the price . <gap> But it's <disfmarker> Yeah .
Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . So uh Um <vocalsound> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . <vocalsound> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So
we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh <disfmarker> I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Okay . Yeah . Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . Ah okay . We can plan further , I think . Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh <disfmarker> How do you call it ? Uh <disfmarker> Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Will come in handy . Mm yeah . I don't know . Yeah . You're the Project Manager . W <vocalsound> He says <disfmarker> if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Yeah . Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh <vocalsound> is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a <disfmarker> Yeah . Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide Yeah . A And then you s then you can delete uh Or edit . the o the obsolete uh details . Okay . So uh I think . each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . Yeah . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . Yeah . one thing uh , Yeah ?
where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um <vocalsound> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . <vocalsound> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . you uh will have uh individual actions
where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um <vocalsound> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . <vocalsound> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So
I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . Yeah . Yeah . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . Mm-hmm . Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? Yeah , Yeah . Look , <vocalsound> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh <disfmarker> Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . No . But when you enter a new market with a remote control and Mm-hmm . uh wanna gain market share Yeah . you have to do something special , I think . Yeah .

And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh <disfmarker> Okay .

we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh <disfmarker> I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Okay . Yeah . Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . Ah okay . We can plan further , I think . Yeah .

And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . Yeah . one thing uh , Yeah ?
Okay . So today is um our third meeting . It will be about the conceptual design <vocalsound> uh . If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings
It will be about the conceptual design <vocalsound> uh . If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us .
Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ?
<vocalsound> Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh Yeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most <disfmarker> what they what they find more more interesting , more <disfmarker> or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . <vocalsound> So now more more cool aspect , ma more <disfmarker> a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with <disfmarker> instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . Okay . in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of <gap> uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's <vocalsound> it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . <vocalsound> Mm . And also <vocalsound> in the in the U_S_A_ the the current <disfmarker> the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . Spongy means eponge ? Mm-hmm . So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so <disfmarker> What what do you mean by <vocalsound> fruit and vegetables and spongy ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . Oh , they're <disfmarker> okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot
buttons are in the frape <disfmarker> shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . Apple for channel one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . But <disfmarker> okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about That's a question . What ? Is fruit cool ? Yeah ? No I think we we should think about a a shape with it <disfmarker> a device with a shape of some <disfmarker> Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . <vocalsound> Yeah . Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , Banana . a cucumber . Mm-hmm . I dunno . Or m Maybe too long . Maybe . Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough <disfmarker> a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . Yeah . Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . new inputs and also it's <disfmarker> I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , So te textu textures , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Vegetable textures and all this kind . Drawings of bananas . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So which fruit are you thinking of ? And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may <disfmarker> could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the <disfmarker> <gap> Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , Yeah maybe the shape the shape <disfmarker>
more things . It's not so simple . you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons <disfmarker> with only a few buttons . For instance , yeah .
Okay , I'll give the floor . So you are User Interface guy . Okay .
I <disfmarker> there's something that I <disfmarker> unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords <disfmarker> speech keywords ? It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . Yeah yeah . So this is not s really to do to to do control . Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an Yeah . This is just more like a poi pois yeah . It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , Yeah yeah . it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to <disfmarker> we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh Completely pointless yeah . <disfmarker> yeah comp <vocalsound> completely pointless <vocalsound> for the inter for <disfmarker> from the interaction point of v point of view <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . So . S next uh slide . Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control <vocalsound> . Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . Mm-hmm .
So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . so um it it <disfmarker> but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
I mean we could have <disfmarker> well , I guess you need an on and off switch , Switch on . Yeah . but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . Um , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our <vocalsound> potential funky-looking uh remote control <disfmarker> <vocalsound> those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , Mm-hmm . but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana It's enough .
mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's <disfmarker> that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , What's a turbo button ? It con it controls the speed ? Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going <disfmarker> if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .
Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . Well , that's the thing ,
and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . Mm-hmm . It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition <disfmarker> the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here
That's right . Okay . So this is going to be about the component design . Mm-hmm . So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies ,
So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your <disfmarker> if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces ,
and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your <disfmarker> if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . Yeah .
And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . And also uh <disfmarker> Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . That's true , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , Yeah . it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's <disfmarker>
The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , So there should <disfmarker> we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve .
But <gap> like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just Poivron . Oui c'est ca Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah . Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? <vocalsound> Uh pepper . And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like No , the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . Yes it is . <vocalsound> Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh <disfmarker>
Yeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . And uh regular chip supports speaker support ,
<vocalsound> I think that's a pretty handy feature . Yeah . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . <gap> So <disfmarker> Uh this is <disfmarker> basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . Mm-hmm . It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh <disfmarker>
If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . Yeah . Yeah , like this colour this colour <disfmarker> Maybe , you know , maybe <disfmarker> like still in the shape of a banana . Roughly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Exactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know <disfmarker> Okay . And <disfmarker> I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I <disfmarker> this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like <disfmarker> it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . <vocalsound> For better <disfmarker> want of a better word
A base station . Right . <vocalsound> We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . <gap> okay , Yeah . Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . We need b R_F_ to beep . Okay , so it's uh <disfmarker> So we <disfmarker> that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . Yeah . So we are going to add uh also um you <disfmarker> as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels Yeah . and your tur turbo turbo uh button . Yeah , which <disfmarker> I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , Turbo button . Yes . Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . And and you have two wheels . So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . <vocalsound> Very good . Okay . Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . Yeah . Okay , so mm <vocalsound> so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um <vocalsound> about what we're going to do . <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm . So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . Okay ?
Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . Well , that's the thing , Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . No we can we can't use that . You <disfmarker> Mm . it's not <disfmarker> Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our <gap> can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . Yeah . So component cost is going to be the least . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . So <disfmarker> Yeah , that would be some development work . So this is out of discussion . Yeah . I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so <disfmarker> Okay .
A base station . Right . <vocalsound> We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . <gap> okay , We need b R_F_ to beep . Okay , so it's uh <disfmarker> So we <disfmarker> that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . Yeah . So we are going to add uh also um you <disfmarker> as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels Yeah . and your tur turbo turbo uh button . Yeah , which <disfmarker> I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , Turbo button . Yes . Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . And and you have two wheels . So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . <vocalsound> Very good . Okay . Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?
everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote Oh , yeah . That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um <disfmarker> But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . What about <disfmarker>
Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well <vocalsound> I'd say let's start with the first presentation . 'Kay . Um in the same order as last time ? W <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Components design , um <vocalsound> uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh <disfmarker> elaborate some of the things I did . and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um <vocalsound> you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . <vocalsound> I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . <vocalsound> Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the <disfmarker> because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control Drop it . Hmm . becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to <disfmarker> it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material . Um <vocalsound> I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . <vocalsound> Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh Okay . I thought of an idea like this . Oh <gap> that . Blank . Okay . So it also looks nice when it's on your table . So you get <gap> uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . Oh so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some <gap> or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . <vocalsound> And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . True . So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it <vocalsound> with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ? Mm-hmm . Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . <vocalsound> they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ? but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <vocalsound> Okay Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ <gap> on the top of the machine . You can put the R_ and R_ . <vocalsound> Uh so they are <vocalsound> pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh <vocalsound> them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control ,
And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh <disfmarker> And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , Mm-hmm . so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . Mm . Alright so <vocalsound> I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh <vocalsound> uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . Mm . This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . Mm . Um perhaps it's useful , Mm . perhaps for because people um lose the remote , Mm . they can yell uh remote where are you and <gap> calls or something . <vocalsound> It's true . And perhaps we could uh implement that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like Oh my God . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so uh don't <vocalsound> make too much of it <vocalsound> . I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw <gap> . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . .. . <gap> and then the buttons above and uh below <vocalsound> the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . Um . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . Ah . Doesn't matter . Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . Mm-hmm . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh <vocalsound> the remote control in a mount station No . But this is a bit uh how I thought it . so that it's better in your hand or something uh . Oh okay , yeah . But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . Oh yeah , <gap> .
<vocalsound> Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'Kay . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's <vocalsound> quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . Fruity ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Like that . The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . Mm . Okay . It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . <vocalsound> Let's build it into a sponge . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges . And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like Oh y <vocalsound> this or something . It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something . <gap> And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but
So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's <vocalsound> quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this .

And the colour should be yellow , or something . <gap> And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs ,
that's uh that's an idea . Yeah . Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <vocalsound> Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll <vocalsound> you'll always get some <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> You always touch it , Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff . But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . Yeah . How yeah how large <disfmarker> You have to you have to <disfmarker> Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . <vocalsound> Yeah they have thick fingers <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , No . hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , Yeah . Y you could include a pen Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use <disfmarker> Use a pen You you c Yeah <gap> the fingers , yeah . Yeah o yeah <gap> , if they think it's handy to use a pen . and <disfmarker> I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something . And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah <gap> Yeah but that that can be <gap> with plain soft tissue . You can do <gap> whatever uh any uh cloth . Okay , what's the standard colour ? work for that ? no we have different colour . I I How many colours are we going to <disfmarker> You got you got different colours , You should you should have a black one but you should have a standard colour . because uh I think black is standard . Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard . With the with the yellow uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But if you want to be different , then uh <disfmarker> Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . Just a regular uh remote colour . And then have uh different covers uh to use . Or or silver . I think it's better to have silver nowadays . Silver , yeah . But still silver and black are <disfmarker> Silver rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . well and between those <vocalsound> is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it y I think it's better to <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have . could be ugly , Yeah th yeah . That's right . yeah . Green , wood , brown . But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . Yeah . Yeah , I understand . Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , Yeah o of course . Yeah . just <disfmarker> The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , <gap> dark red and brown . Fruity . Okay . Okay , so <disfmarker> And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh <disfmarker> Who's pinging ? And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . Yeah . And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , It's rubber . we wanted to make it from rubber Yeah and uh <disfmarker> but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber or <disfmarker> Uh hard rubber I think . Yeah . Yeah sure , We have different colours . look <vocalsound> . this in different colours ? So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? D No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . <vocalsound> Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people . Yeah . I think so too . Yeah . But that's what we want , <gap> . Yeah , that's our target . Yeah . it was . Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? Oh yeah that that <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> So i I thought that was a quite good Yeah . Did you write that down ? And then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured <vocalsound> remote control . <vocalsound> And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? It was one remote , I think , Different colours , yeah . different colours . We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe <disfmarker> You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh Yeah . Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? the shape of it . Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Yeah , Round but square . <vocalsound> s round corners , but s but square , yeah . <gap> Yeah . But maybe then both groups won't buy it . Yeah . like <vocalsound> like this <vocalsound> uh a bit . Yeah . So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . Kinda like a beer glass . <vocalsound> Yeah . Will recognise that's as a remote control . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Look something like that <gap> . Autumn colours like red , brown . Uh when I saw your d So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . Yeah . Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . Yeah . And the old people , old and boring . <gap> and colour <gap> way easier than yeah the shapes . In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones <vocalsound> So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . Yeah think uh <disfmarker> Soft rubber . Also in between . <vocalsound> No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , Yeah . Yeah , something like this , yeah . But it's quite hard , this . Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . Yeah . So we should first decide about shape , I think . Ding ding . Um I also s uh can't help but notice <vocalsound> that you uh used an <disfmarker> you had a remote control <gap> <vocalsound> and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like <disfmarker> Yeah This was your size , Yeah . but I think it should be larger . Yeah three quarter of the of the <disfmarker> Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> oh . Or should it be larger ? Yeah . Larger I think . Larger ?
because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big Yeah . so as its its really an important function of the remote . I think the left s under corner should be the best . Any more uh <disfmarker> So well uh <vocalsound> Interface type . type , supplements , anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ The L_C_D_ yeah , I think it's better to just <gap> up what you'd like to do on the screen . <gap> If you want to go back you have to back button go back , <gap> Yeah . if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . Hey , <vocalsound> Um yeah . Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> the the young people do like uh scroll uh Use the scroll . I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu <gap> they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh <disfmarker> Fast , if you've got a settings , if you <disfmarker> Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . Y Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . Sure . So we can discuss these points . <gap> those points um energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how <disfmarker> are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put <gap> in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . <vocalsound> I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh <disfmarker> The docking station . Yeah . Yeah . So that's the the the first point . Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting . W <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . which you can recharge through the docking station . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . if the badg the batteries are dead Just like with the telephone . I kinda like your <disfmarker> then you can re you can uh change them . Yeah Kinda like those kind of batteries . Yep . <vocalsound> but it should be th I think normal batteries , <vocalsound> you <disfmarker> No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Simple rechargeable uh batteries . Yeah . Um what was with the chip on print ? The chip on print ? Um <disfmarker> Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a <vocalsound> simple uh a sim not a simple but a <disfmarker> Print plate . Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? You still have a print plate . Uh <gap> Always , so <disfmarker> I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . Yeah well and I didn't have any information about it , chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the buttons are not always on the same place , Yeah , okay . When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , and you got on the and on the <disfmarker> <gap> I suppose so . you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's <disfmarker> It is a simple C_P_U_ because it has to uh b Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . Yeah , okay , true true . True . So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that <gap> . Well . At least uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh <gap> if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . Mm-hmm . Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? I don't know . Depends on the screen . Th If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle <disfmarker> Square . <gap> I think it's it's easier to have it something like <disfmarker> Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . <gap> Oh , okay . And on here . Yeah . The other buttons and on here <vocalsound> the top . The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , I think that's a matter of what you're used to . Something uh <disfmarker> I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . <vocalsound> Perhaps I have some examples . W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <vocalsound> I don't know <disfmarker> She is . <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . So not how much <disfmarker> n not how often it's used , but <disfmarker> W what's what's usual or normal . Yeah , I think it's <gap> it's a <disfmarker> I think <gap> because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , Yeah . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . <gap> Okay , no problem . And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Interface , yeah . And the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh <disfmarker> Makes it possible to <disfmarker> But then you should also find a place <disfmarker> Yeah . You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . Mm . because a lotta <disfmarker> you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh <vocalsound> just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . Yeah . Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh But <disfmarker> over there . So , But that's not import I think that's not im very important in the middle or something . <gap> Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . Inside . You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out I i between the round of the R_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> maybe where the one hand <disfmarker> Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh <disfmarker> Yeah Uh . So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that . Yeah , okay .
Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , Ooh . <vocalsound>
Yeah . Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , No .
So that's the the the first point . <vocalsound> Yeah . you <disfmarker> No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh <vocalsound> the remote control in a mount station Yeah . Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting . W <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . which you can recharge through the docking station . Yeah .
When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a <vocalsound> simple uh a sim not a simple but a <disfmarker> Print plate . Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , and you got on the and on the <disfmarker>
it was . Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? Oh yeah that that <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> So i I thought that was a quite good Yeah . Did you write that down ? And then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured <vocalsound> remote control . <vocalsound>
Did you write that down ? And then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured <vocalsound> remote control . <vocalsound> And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , It's rubber . we wanted to make it from rubber Yeah
Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . Y Yeah , okay , true . Yeah . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , Okay . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . <gap> Okay , no problem . And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side Yeah , yeah .
that's uh that's an idea . Yeah . Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <vocalsound> Because when you put your f Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . So it meets this in different colours ? So So we should first decide about shape , I think . Ding ding . the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? D No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . <vocalsound> Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? the shape of it . Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Yeah , Round but square . <vocalsound> s round corners , but s but square , yeah . <gap> Yeah . This was your size , Yeah . But maybe then both groups won't buy it . Yeah . but I think it should be larger . Yeah like <vocalsound> like this <vocalsound> uh a bit . Yeah . So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . Kinda like a beer glass . <vocalsound> Yeah .
So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . Yeah think uh <disfmarker> Soft rubber . Also in between . <vocalsound> No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , Yeah . Yeah , something like this , yeah . Yeah and uh <disfmarker> but you can press it in . Yeah . but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber But it's quite hard , this . Yeah it's quite hard or <disfmarker> Uh hard rubber I think . Yeah .
Yeah . Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , No . hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , Yeah . Y you could include a pen Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use <disfmarker> Use a pen You you c Yeah <gap> the fingers , yeah . Yeah o yeah <gap> , if they think it's handy to use a pen . and <disfmarker>
Yeah . So that's the the the first point . Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting . W <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . which you can recharge through the docking station . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . if the badg the batteries are dead Just like with the telephone . I kinda like your <disfmarker> then you can re you can uh change them . Yeah Kinda like those kind of batteries . Yep . <vocalsound> but it should be th I think normal batteries , <vocalsound> you <disfmarker> No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah .
<gap> I suppose so . you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's <disfmarker> It is a simple C_P_U_ because it has to uh b Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . Yeah , okay , true true . True . So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .
I think it's <gap> it's a <disfmarker> I think <gap> because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , Yeah . Yeah well Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? I don't know . I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how Depends on the screen . Th If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle <disfmarker> Square . <gap> I think it's it's easier to have it something like <disfmarker> Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . <gap> Oh , okay . And on here . Yeah . The other buttons and on here <vocalsound> the top . The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , I think that's a matter of what you're used to . Something uh <disfmarker> I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . <vocalsound> Perhaps I have some examples . W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <vocalsound> I don't know <disfmarker> She is . <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . So not how much <disfmarker> n not how often it's used , but <disfmarker> W what's what's usual or normal . Yeah ,
because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big Yeah . Makes it possible to <disfmarker> But then you should also find a place <disfmarker> Yeah . You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . Mm . because a lotta <disfmarker> you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh <vocalsound> just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . Yeah . Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh But <disfmarker> over there . So , But that's not import I think that's not im very important in the middle or something . <gap> Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . Inside . You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out I i between the round of the R_ . Yeah . <vocalsound>
and between those <vocalsound> is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it y I think it's better to <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have . could be ugly , Yeah th yeah . That's right . yeah . Green , wood , brown . But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . Yeah . Yeah , I understand . Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , Yeah o of course . Yeah . just <disfmarker> The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , <gap> dark red and brown . Fruity . Okay . Okay , so <disfmarker> And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh <disfmarker> Who's pinging ? Okay , what's the standard colour ? work for that ? no we have different colour . I I How many colours are we going to <disfmarker> You got you got different colours , You should you should have a black one but you should have a standard colour . because uh I think black is standard . Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard . With the with the yellow uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But if you want to be different , then uh <disfmarker> Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . Just a regular uh remote colour . And then have uh different covers uh to use . Or or silver . I think it's better to have silver nowadays . Silver , yeah . But still silver and black are <disfmarker> Silver rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . well
So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and our Industrial Designer , Baba . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . You know wi <vocalsound> the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i Okay . So where's the battery battery ? The battery it is under <gap> . It is in th in <disfmarker> in the base , yeah . <vocalsound> In the base . Where is the solar cell ? In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and <disfmarker> Oh . uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> keep on speaking . yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah , that's true . Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel <vocalsound> okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button .
Looks strange . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , <vocalsound> so , my mush <disfmarker> . <gap> Looks like more fruit . Yeah , but you don't have any button now . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . <vocalsound> Yeah . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Mush Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <vocalsound> like lemon shape , you know , Mushroom design , yeah . that's a good idea . So that's great . <vocalsound> It looks <vocalsound> more like a pineapple .
<vocalsound> Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , Will you give four ? those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . Five ? you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? Yeah . I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have <disfmarker> you just turn the turn the ball . Yeah but y you know <gap> <disfmarker> so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? Mm-hmm . This has to stay on the table . <vocalsound> In fact on a flat place <disfmarker> I i this is just a base . True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . I p is th y <vocalsound> It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . <vocalsound> You need to put it on and turn . <vocalsound> You know tha that's the weak point , <vocalsound> You use your y Nobody would take it . <vocalsound> Sure . <vocalsound> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . So nobody w will lost <disfmarker> lose it . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Mush Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <vocalsound> like lemon shape , you know , Mushroom design , yeah . Okay . Mm . Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine , No , I mean , yeah <vocalsound> yeah . Inspira inspiration is <disfmarker> And inspired colour <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> and very sophisticated material , so . True . The sha the bowl shape people like . Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour <disfmarker> Maybe if you change <disfmarker> if you take the buttons out , <vocalsound> Do Don't do that , please . I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh , for turn turn the ball . I have no idea , so . <vocalsound> If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . <vocalsound> I have no idea <vocalsound> what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And where is the voice recognition ? Okay . Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . <vocalsound> Wait th that's the second point . This is microphone array <disfmarker> First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . If it is fancy or not . let's say it's a pineapple now . <vocalsound> The colour , is the colour acceptable ? <vocalsound> No , the colour is okay , that's fine . So the shape now . I mean it's <disfmarker> It looks like a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but I would say there is more <disfmarker> too much red . now you took it . It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Right . So , from one to seven ? <vocalsound> I will give <disfmarker> I will <disfmarker> 'Kay Three . Isn't it bitter like that <gap> ? Then <vocalsound> uh let me <disfmarker> What other <disfmarker> The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . Is it easy to use ? <vocalsound> Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . It's a micro array , okay . There four microphone . Oh . And I think you <disfmarker> you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is <disfmarker> Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . I <vocalsound> W Yeah , but <disfmarker> We have tactile buttons . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You take take <vocalsound> the remote , so <disfmarker> and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . when you stop , the the turn , Mm-hmm . then the angle you stop is the angle you <disfmarker> is the channel you <disfmarker> Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the <disfmarker> So you you count <gap> one degree , two degrees , no .
yeah it's a sleeping remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , sleeping . Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . Solar . <vocalsound> To compensate <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? Yeah . I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have <disfmarker> you just turn the turn the ball . Yeah but y you know <gap> <disfmarker> so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? Mm-hmm . This has to stay on the table . <vocalsound> In fact on a flat place <disfmarker> I i this is just a base . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . <vocalsound> You need to put it on and turn . <vocalsound> You know tha that's the weak point , <vocalsound> You use your y Nobody would take it . <vocalsound> Sure . <vocalsound> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . So nobody w will lost <disfmarker> lose it . Okay , so <disfmarker> It need maybe some wo further work , but it's <disfmarker> Yeah , especially on the easy to use Yeah , uh s yeah . Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice <disfmarker> yeah , you c And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . And I think you <disfmarker> you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is <disfmarker> Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . We have tactile buttons . Mm-hmm . I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have <disfmarker> Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe <disfmarker> okay . I think technically it's acceptable , so <disfmarker> Maybe two ? I would say two . You agree ? Yeah , it's very easy . You just need the command . Yeah but this this turning <disfmarker> You can use this in this way . So you can turn to change the channel . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? You just tu turn d d You take take <vocalsound> the remote , so <disfmarker> and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . but maybe it will be too fast . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to <disfmarker> if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . Yeah . then the angle you stop is the angle you <disfmarker> is the channel you <disfmarker> Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the <disfmarker> So you you count <gap> one degree , two degrees , no . I think so <vocalsound> I think so you can do it . <vocalsound> I think so , you can just change . I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so <disfmarker> Okay . So it's coarse to fine design . that's very technologic , so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Okay , so <disfmarker> It need maybe some wo further work , but it's <disfmarker> Yeah , especially on the easy to use Yeah , uh s yeah . Yeah , b I think <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . Yeah .
<vocalsound> So we need to calculate the production cost . Mm-hmm . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . Mm-hmm . but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or <disfmarker> such as Uh I think in each ball you have three <disfmarker> <vocalsound> as number of branches ? So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? Yeah . Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? Mm . One maybe , yeah . As we have voice recognition , I think . Is sh it <gap> So we are all already nineteen . Wooden . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . The solar cell is too expensive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Is <disfmarker> Yes a wooden pl I and that's <disfmarker> There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . Well uh <disfmarker> yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . That's gonna be double curved , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . We have two special colours . Push button . Mm . Yeah , we have four . <vocalsound> Five . <vocalsound> No no no , it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . Yeah . Um , no . Okay we <disfmarker> I think we have problem . <vocalsound> L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . I think we s if we keep on adding things <disfmarker> It's okay . <vocalsound> <gap> fine <gap> . so we have to <disfmarker> Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? Yeah . No y i it did change , but Okay . We have change the electronics to <disfmarker> from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . just imagine we have <disfmarker> I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Advanced version we have speak . Wait . Red and yellow . We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Fancy . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . How about we change the sale ? Double curved . Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . Something flat . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . That's fine . That's fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Agree . So we have one button , So <vocalsound> yeah , you will have <disfmarker> <gap> One s one scroll wheel , so one wheel .
Cou could we have look <disfmarker> Wha what <disfmarker> yeah . It's fine , twelve fifty uh <disfmarker> Which part is the most expensive part ? <vocalsound> I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Advanced version we have speak . Wait . Red and yellow . We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Fancy . No , um solar cells , yeah . but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . How about we change the sale ? Double curved . Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . Something flat . That's fine . That's fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Agree . So we have one button , So <vocalsound> yeah , you will have <disfmarker> <gap> One s one scroll wheel , so one wheel . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is
Our final prototype which <disfmarker> yeah . So what i and do w is it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> do you think you can celebrate your creation ? And you can celebrate your leadership . <vocalsound> Oh , thanks a lot . <vocalsound> Okay , okay , it's fine . I dunno . So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? Yes . Of course . This is my job . <vocalsound> Yeah ? <vocalsound> Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to <disfmarker> from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <vocalsound> informative for <gap> . Yeah . And for the marketing guy ? Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . Yep <vocalsound> . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it <disfmarker> um . Okay . I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . <vocalsound> Wh really ? Yeah . <vocalsound> No , it's not so expensive . and we have a nearly final product .
Looks <disfmarker> okay , <vocalsound> let's say it's a pineapple now . <vocalsound> that's a good idea . So that's great . <vocalsound> It looks <vocalsound> more like a pineapple . <vocalsound> The colour , is the colour acceptable ? Yeah , b I think <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . Yeah .
Is <disfmarker> Yes a wooden pl I and that's <disfmarker> There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . Well uh <disfmarker> I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Advanced version we have speak .
How about we change the sale ? Double curved . Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . Something flat .
Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? Yeah .
So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . So we have one button , So <vocalsound> yeah , you will have <disfmarker> <gap> One s one scroll wheel , so one wheel .
So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . <vocalsound> An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . That's fine . That's fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Agree . So we have one button , So <vocalsound> yeah , you will have <disfmarker>
It's <disfmarker> yeah but it <disfmarker> I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ <disfmarker> Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . Yeah . So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . Mm . True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . I p is th y <vocalsound> because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . Still that was one of the requirements we had .
Yeah Oh . Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Really ? Fruits and vegetables . But <disfmarker> so , my mush <disfmarker> . <gap> Looks like more fruit . Yeah , but you don't have any button now . that's a good idea . So that's great . <vocalsound> It looks <vocalsound> more like a pineapple . <vocalsound> Looks <disfmarker> okay , <vocalsound> let's say it's a pineapple now . <vocalsound> The colour , is the colour acceptable ? It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . <vocalsound> Yeah . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Mush Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <vocalsound> like lemon shape , you know , Mushroom design , yeah .
So you can turn to change the channel . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? You just tu turn d d Uh , for turn turn the ball . I have no idea , so . <vocalsound> If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . <vocalsound> but maybe it will be too fast . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to <disfmarker> if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? Mm-hmm . This has to stay on the table . <vocalsound> In fact on a flat place <disfmarker> I i this is just a base . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . <vocalsound> You need to put it on and turn . <vocalsound> You know tha that's the weak point , <vocalsound> You use your y uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button .
Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , <gap> . <vocalsound> because that's going to influence our design . Oh no . It's not much . It's just one question . Because we have a problem . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> . It has to be twelve and a half . Yeah . Oh my goodness . So <disfmarker> You're going to redesign something . <vocalsound> Oh no . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Uh , yeah . <vocalsound>
Uh , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . Wh what we could do is um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . Yeah . Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That's what I was thinking . Uh then we have left <disfmarker> <gap> we <disfmarker> But we don't have any basic options any more . <vocalsound> And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . F_ eight . They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . Yep . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> So let's go for the plastic . So we do one one s Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . Yeah . No no it has to be curved . Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So <disfmarker> Well yeah . So the only option is an hand dynamo . Exactly .
Uh well no I was wrong . <vocalsound> There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Yep . Speech recognition . Yeah . Could drop the speech recognition . <vocalsound> Right . so we can might as well s drop that . <gap> And drop it yeah ? Yeah . Let's drop the speech . Yeah . That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one Yeah . <disfmarker> I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . Mm-hmm .
ma make it a special colour then . Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . Yeah ? Well not all . Not s not sound I guess . But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> You were saying something . That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one Yeah . <disfmarker> I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . Mm-hmm . if you lose the the Back , the Okay button <disfmarker> Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . Yeah . Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . Yeah . With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . And <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh <disfmarker> Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . If you if you go to <disfmarker>
Add them ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Could somebody start calculator ? <vocalsound> Ah we can do the math . Uh <disfmarker> I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . Mm-hmm . Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . Yeah . So thr t two . Uh you put it in the <gap> . We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the <disfmarker> Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Yeah . F_ five . Um <disfmarker> Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . By nine . Hmm . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , That's uh three uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or le less than a three . So <disfmarker> I don't know it's open yet . No . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ? di divided by nine Oh . I don't know . Um <disfmarker> Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ? <vocalsound> I think it does . Because the operating <gap> behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ? makes three point one one one one one one one . So we're better than average . Three ? Yeah . Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . <vocalsound> Hey , you're marketing , eh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . It hides uh basic functions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Everything . <vocalsound> You don't use anything else . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . <vocalsound> You're not gonna find them . Yeah the next <disfmarker> Not so much so . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Nope . You say you double click on the <disfmarker> It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Yeah . Five or six ? Five . Okay five . Five . Yep . <vocalsound> Well it's different . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . But <disfmarker> Uh yep . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . Yeah , it's still <disfmarker> Yeah , I say two . <vocalsound> We still have the fruit and vegetable print . It's way more practical , yeah . Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . <vocalsound> It should have been two questions . <vocalsound> I realise now , because <vocalsound> sponge-like material is dropped . Yeah . You still have rubber d Or no . Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . No you got a plastic . <vocalsound> Yeah . The one . Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something . Four . Yeah . worth the <disfmarker> Yeah . We have something . Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . Yeah . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . New . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I like bold . <vocalsound> Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . <vocalsound> Um oh yeah . We have a we have a <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , <vocalsound> if there's only one thing . Hell yeah . If we have only one button . And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> The remote control is easy to use . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Well I would say <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . <vocalsound> The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . Ah i It gives visual feedback . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . <vocalsound> I would say six . I think a five . Five . <vocalsound> What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? It's really not easy to use . <vocalsound> Um well , another question , Yeah that looks uh great . uh the remote control is durable . <vocalsound> I don't know if that's the correct word . Yeah . Nah <disfmarker> Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic But uh <disfmarker> <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . True , true . And the casing is plastic , <gap> ? Yep . Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . Yeah . So I would go for one . Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate Yeah . S <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay I will go <disfmarker> go for two . <vocalsound> Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . <vocalsound> Oh . Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . It's not <disfmarker> it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . Yeah . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah , four is okay . Alright , yeah . Right . So <disfmarker> So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . That's it .
di divided by nine So thr t two . makes three point one one one one one one one . So we're better than average . But <disfmarker>
We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but <disfmarker> Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay it's your turn now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> With some casing around it , yeah . Black . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? Yeah uh <disfmarker> But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh <disfmarker> The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> oh no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do we have to do other things ? Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . Or just redesign ? <vocalsound> Alright . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . Yeah . So you made a start , right ? Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . Should give it some time ? Yay . Uh <disfmarker> Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? I was here . So <disfmarker> Uh that's the infrared uh <vocalsound> thing . <vocalsound> Oh yeah , of course . The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . Yeah . It's gonna be one str scroll . How many pages ? <vocalsound> Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . Is it more natural than this ? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . Yeah , yeah . Uh it <disfmarker> it's it's not <disfmarker> Yeah . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay . It's really ugly . Yeah . That looks little bit more uh <disfmarker> Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ? <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah can we do it uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh can we do a print ? I'm not sure . I think we have to choose , yeah ? Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? Yeah . Oh no my remote has acne . ... . We have the original balance sheet , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . No , it looks <disfmarker> It's called the Real Remote , right ? Yeah . Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . Yeah You can copy and paste the picture if you want . How <gap> <disfmarker> Shall we do the logo in black or not ? Mm . It is <disfmarker> I mean is it gonna <disfmarker> Well it's it's single single curved . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that <disfmarker> Yeah ? That okay ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? I guess so . Yeah . Yeah but only the the financial parts uh <disfmarker> I mean <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . I Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh We were pretty democratic . the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . So and the <disfmarker> uh about the board <gap> digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or <disfmarker> Ooh . <vocalsound> the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . <vocalsound> It's uh it's <disfmarker> And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . Yeah . Warning . Finish meeting now . Finish meeting . Okay , are are there <vocalsound> any new ideas about this ? All I think <disfmarker> I didn't really receive , yeah . Well , it <disfmarker> It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . <vocalsound> Uh uh w uh <disfmarker> the <gap> screen and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . Yeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an <disfmarker> a small audience , and then to <disfmarker> Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But <disfmarker> Yeah next . Next slide . Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright . So how were <disfmarker> did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh <disfmarker> Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . Yeah . And we move more to to working together as team , No . because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . Mm-hmm . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , Mm-hmm . and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So <disfmarker> The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah we <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . Mm-hmm .
and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So <disfmarker> The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah we <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . Mm-hmm .
That okay ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? I guess so . Yeah . Yeah but only the the financial parts uh <disfmarker> I mean <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . I Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh We were pretty democratic .
Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh We were pretty democratic . the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . So and the <disfmarker> uh about the board <gap> digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or <disfmarker> Ooh . <vocalsound> the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . <vocalsound> It's uh it's <disfmarker> And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . Yeah . the <gap> screen and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . Yeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an <disfmarker> a small audience , and then to <disfmarker> Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But <disfmarker>
after after these five minutes , you have to <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . What's this anyway ?
Yeah . Let's drop the speech . Yeah . so we can might as well s drop that . <gap> And drop it yeah ?
Yep . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> So let's go for the plastic . So we do one one s
Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . Yeah . With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . And <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh <disfmarker> Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . If you if you go to <disfmarker>
Yeah true . Yeah . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . Yeah hand dynamo ? Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So <disfmarker> Well yeah . So the only option is an hand dynamo . Exactly .
It's not much . It's just one question . Because we have a problem . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> . It has to be twelve and a half . Yeah . Oh my goodness . So <disfmarker> You're going to redesign something . <vocalsound> Oh no . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Uh , yeah . <vocalsound>
Well not all . Not s not sound I guess . But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . <vocalsound> No . Speech recognition . Yeah . Could drop the speech recognition . <vocalsound> Right . Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . Mm-hmm . Uh well no I was wrong . <vocalsound> There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Yep . Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That's what I was thinking . Uh then we have left <disfmarker> <gap> we <disfmarker> But we don't have any basic options any more . <vocalsound>
. <vocalsound> It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . Did I save it ?
So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So <disfmarker> Yeah true . Yes , so the <disfmarker> It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . <vocalsound> You're not gonna find them . Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . Yeah true . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . <gap> . Yeah true . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I Are you sure we <disfmarker> this number actually tells us somethings ? No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . Some questions are <disfmarker> Yeah . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low <disfmarker> the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question <disfmarker> Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . No ?
So , our new project is about <disfmarker> we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . Just for T_V_ remote control .
I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . My name is Mark Yes . <vocalsound> Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . Um I will be uh <gap> Pr Project <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . And I will see what the user wants Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . Yeah . My name is Xavier Juergens ,
we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . Yeah .
We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just Uh . Okay . Every meeting we <disfmarker> everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have <disfmarker> we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's <disfmarker> just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now .
What do we <disfmarker> This <disfmarker> Quick <gap> <disfmarker> What we're going to <disfmarker> Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . <vocalsound> Okay .
Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . I introduce to the world the amazing ant . <vocalsound> it should <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it <disfmarker> that it represents . next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , next , been here . <vocalsound> Well , <gap> gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So That's it . Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you very much . So , draw us your favourite animal . <vocalsound> Well ,
The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? Well , I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> I mean , really disabled people , yeah , <vocalsound> might be a problem , but I think it's a little <gap> take it into consideration . Um yeah . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's <disfmarker> and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? Yeah , we want <disfmarker>
The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . So , our new project is about <disfmarker> we need design a remote control for television set , so , Just for T_V_ remote control .
Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . Yeah . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it <disfmarker> revolutionary changes , Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . yes .
I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> I mean , really disabled people , yeah , <vocalsound> might be a problem , but I think it's a little <gap> take it into consideration . Um yeah . and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? Yeah , we want <disfmarker>
Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's <disfmarker>
welcome back . <vocalsound> At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . <vocalsound> Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um <vocalsound> uh I had an email from the from the management board <vocalsound> uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . <vocalsound> Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , <vocalsound> so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . <vocalsound> Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh <disfmarker> would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . <vocalsound>
and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um , we have three audiences of <disfmarker> two audiences , <vocalsound> I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five <gap> age . Uh the second one is from sixty four <disfmarker> uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent <disfmarker> um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . Mm <vocalsound> and some interests from the from the age groups , 'Kay , welcome . I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level , Mm-hmm . which I will show you . <vocalsound> The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . Um <vocalsound> one hundred respondents were involved
Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . Mm <vocalsound> and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um , <vocalsound> and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh <disfmarker> Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . Second findings <vocalsound> out of the questionnaire um are the opinion <vocalsound> the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um <vocalsound> following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the <disfmarker> these three points . Switching channels , um yeah , that's pretty uh pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want <disfmarker> wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . But it's strange that the the manage board <disfmarker> the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . Yeah , okay . So that that's strange . Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is <disfmarker> Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . Yeah , okay . when you ask people , what do they use , <vocalsound> they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . Okay .
that's a cool idea . where you can put the the remote control in . <vocalsound> Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah . When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that Uh not not the r not the functions , what what are you think about ? but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . <vocalsound> Uh , the funtionability . So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons . Yeah , j just to t to get it done if necessary , <vocalsound> but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or <disfmarker> Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . Yeah , perhaps . Just for the minor functions perhaps . Yeah . Okay , my personal preferences . Um , I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . <vocalsound> Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um <vocalsound> second point , <vocalsound> we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . Third point um that came out of the uh <disfmarker> of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ Yeah ,
Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one
and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh <gap> a cheap uh remote . Well uh but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh <disfmarker> well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth <gap> or or radio waves , <vocalsound> although <disfmarker> What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? Yeah , So it's in the wrong product . Yeah . Yeah , I actually <disfmarker> I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh <disfmarker> the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,
but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost <gap> that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore .
and you u u use <disfmarker> you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh <disfmarker> w spend more time on those . Uh I I think we should stick by <disfmarker> with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . So uh no input from the television . So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so Um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . Yes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or <disfmarker> and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? Huh . Mm-hmm . 'Cause that would be <disfmarker> I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . Yeah . Yeah . These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . So I I <disfmarker> my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . Um , well Yeah . we should uh look into the design and the functionability . Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh <gap> stuff . And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . So that was my uh my personal opinion . I dunno uh what the cost <gap> that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use <disfmarker> you could just go out and buy a new one . So we didn't <disfmarker> and we don't have to do all uh <disfmarker> to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <disfmarker> there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh <disfmarker> immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button So that's just to uh to to explain the <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said
<vocalsound> Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , <vocalsound> so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh <disfmarker> if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , Hmm . since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , <vocalsound> Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give <vocalsound> a dr direct action , not first select <disfmarker> Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , Yeah , so uh and so that's where the difficulties lie . Yeah , so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . but <disfmarker> Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , Mm-hmm . Okay . or do we want to use um many buttons . Yeah . weighing those factors . Hmm <gap> it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ <vocalsound> or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , Yeah . and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or <disfmarker> that you can drop down . Yeah , but when all the questions I had <disfmarker> Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . Mm . that's my recommendation , Nah . if you use many options in one buttle <disfmarker> button , um display the menu on the T_V_ Mm-hmm . and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , Yeah . is too complicated for most users . Yeah . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . Yeah , that will be a problem . or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not <disfmarker> our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . Yes . as you already told , give some feedback . Yeah . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . And um , well , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t
and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . Yeah , yeah , Uh uh I think that will be great . Okay . So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . Yeah , I think so . Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . Yeah , of course . Yeah . And so um an elder designer picks up th the <disfmarker> of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um , Mm-hmm . like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh Yeah . but children uh <disfmarker> if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or <disfmarker> Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no ? That is possible , well Th there's just <disfmarker> that actually depends on the television , but I think <disfmarker> I figure that would be <disfmarker> y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , Yeah . the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , that's that why we're here . Yeah , <vocalsound> th th those things are nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel <vocalsound> later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen Partial . yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals Yeah . uh and uh <vocalsound> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , Mm-hmm . but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers Yeah , that's just as e just as easy . Uh . I I do <disfmarker> You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . Yeah , okay . but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . Yeah , it's different . W we are aiming for younger people Yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . So that's that's probably uh a <disfmarker> And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , Mm-hmm . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . so <disfmarker> A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . Mm-hmm . Mm <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , I th I think we can do that too . as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <vocalsound> are done . Moment . Ooh . Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh <disfmarker> we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't <disfmarker> uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically <vocalsound> each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the <disfmarker> done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh Yeah , but that's not possible . then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume Mm-hmm , mm yeah . and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from <disfmarker> Well there are universal d um um remotes Yeah . and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . But they <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> And it's not too complex to do it . <gap> Well No . they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ Yeah . and that that is bit of a tricky job . Yeah . Just build it in . Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press <disfmarker> yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . Yeah . Yes . In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , Yeah , well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , Mm-hmm . Ah it is . It is definitely po But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote <disfmarker> We have five minutes to go . Yeah . Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing New remote ? Maybe , or an update , software update . A firmware upgrade or something , No m may no , Yeah . maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . and they can download it for you . Yeah . Or you could <disfmarker> well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . so maybe j they <disfmarker> we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh <disfmarker> Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh <disfmarker> well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , Receiving . Oh yeah . but <disfmarker> I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs <gap> uh with with it Difficult . let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh <disfmarker> Um m for which one are we going ? <gap> My mistake . That one or uh <disfmarker> Yeah , my vote goes out to the right <gap> . Your vote and your <disfmarker> And your vote ? Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . Yeah . Yeah . And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . Opens up So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um <vocalsound> especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . Not embed Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could <disfmarker> could make more menu up <disfmarker> pop up or something . And yeah , or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . Mm-hmm . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Yeah . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea Yeah . then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? The extra functions . The extra functions , Yeah , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , but l like menu functions or <disfmarker> and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . <vocalsound> Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet Yeah , I think so . and uh I'll just make um <disfmarker> uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with <disfmarker> or sub-items , sub-functions . Yeah . Well um then I'd like to make a proposal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If you make one big touch screen , Yes . use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available Yeah . Yeah .
I don't think I can uh say much about it , to our P_C_s . Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally , Ah . yeah . <vocalsound> Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes <disfmarker> uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . Thirty minutes ? Oh yeah , it's not connected to the You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . <vocalsound> Failure . Uh <vocalsound> uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will <disfmarker> all will receive uh at the uh the the email .
I don't think I can uh say much about it , <vocalsound> Failure . Uh <vocalsound> uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will <disfmarker> all will receive uh at the uh the the email .
Oh yeah , it's not connected to the You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . to our P_C_s .
W we are aiming for younger people Yeah . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . so <disfmarker> A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . Mm-hmm . Mm <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , I th I think we can do that too . as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <vocalsound> are done . Partial . yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals Yeah . uh and uh <vocalsound> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , Mm-hmm . but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers Yeah , that's just as e just as easy . Uh . I I do <disfmarker> You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . Yeah , okay . but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . Yeah , it's different .
that's that why we're here . Yeah , <vocalsound> th th those things are nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel <vocalsound> later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume Mm-hmm , mm yeah . and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from <disfmarker> uh with uh <disfmarker> we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something ,
<vocalsound> Very good <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . <vocalsound> So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to <disfmarker> through the minutes of previous meeting . So uh <vocalsound> basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for <disfmarker> about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you . <vocalsound> And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you Mm . Alright <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of <disfmarker> to give a name to the project .
Alright <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of <disfmarker> to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should <disfmarker> we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ? Mm-hmm . Uh the Powerstick . <vocalsound> Powerstick , yeah . What else ? Uh . <vocalsound> Maybe a Spanish name would work well . Mm I was thinking of the <disfmarker> Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . Mando . Mando . What is that ? Mango ? Mango ? Mando . Mando . M_A_ ? but maybe for a Spanish <disfmarker> for I <disfmarker> for <disfmarker> Oh . What does it mean in Spanish ? Control . Control . Hmm . Nice . The Mando . Okay . <vocalsound> So , let's go for Mando ? Yeah ? No objection ?
For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . And also I di I did a study with <disfmarker> for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been <disfmarker> have remained the same for the last five , ten years . Sh next slide ? Okay . Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> more <disfmarker> most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . And also I found that young people <disfmarker> the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . Okay . So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in my opinion the Mando <disfmarker> this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like <disfmarker> the the liklier it is to get lost . but <vocalsound> they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . So it may be interesting to to think in a <disfmarker> in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some <disfmarker> a a small fraction of of this remote controls . Well maybe it could be a universal design . Sorry ? Maybe maybe I should uh start . So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . Yeah .
No it could be command control kind of thing . It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . Means you say <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that <disfmarker> this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco yeah . And then finally <disfmarker> And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . Yeah . Yeah . First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff But most of <disfmarker> yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . because uh because <disfmarker> Yeah . I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think <disfmarker> if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the <disfmarker>
And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one <disfmarker> maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of <disfmarker> you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's <vocalsound> extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um <vocalsound> a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . but , you know , later on you could you can you know you <disfmarker> also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as <disfmarker> at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really <disfmarker> yeah it doe it's <disfmarker> well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions <disfmarker> d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , Now um uh the <disfmarker> I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . One possibility , if we <disfmarker> now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen So , I mean there are <vocalsound> there are uh cheaper <disfmarker> this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that ,
now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And <gap> was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I I would <disfmarker> if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . Mm-hmm . H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the <disfmarker> see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to <disfmarker> very different build <disfmarker> very different to the traditional <disfmarker> It does sampling out of the <gap> . <gap> yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this <disfmarker> a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh <disfmarker> something that would be worth implementing .
though I don't have much idea , but as he <disfmarker> the uh Marketing Expert presentation was <disfmarker> I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <vocalsound> everyone will s will buy it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually I'm not so sure <vocalsound> So if we go with just the <disfmarker> I'm sure . because I'm the <disfmarker> you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm <disfmarker> instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . That's right . Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much <disfmarker> what kind of microphones and stuff like that . Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well <disfmarker> of such technologies is enough ? Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . Okay . Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones Hmm . No it it could be little d yeah it could be <disfmarker> So it could be s a few centimetres . <vocalsound> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , That's right . That's right . To have different technologies . So this was the <disfmarker> my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know <vocalsound> turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button
So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . Yeah . That increases the the cost also . Uh that's right . Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology .
So the com the um <vocalsound> the uh <vocalsound> the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . Mm-hmm . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . We are targeting T_V_ . <vocalsound> We need <vocalsound> we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have <disfmarker> With a good shape for the <disfmarker> or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ <vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . You just say channel fifty , and that's it . I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know . But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , Means th yeah twenty five Euros is <disfmarker> yeah , that's right . Well this is what we need to find out . it's <disfmarker> Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need <disfmarker> To move to another target ? no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . It is up to you to go through this um <vocalsound> uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . I'm not confident enough . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh <disfmarker> well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible . Yeah . So I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the <disfmarker> than the L_C_D_ . I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that <disfmarker> any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh Uh <disfmarker> of increasing the unit price . What would be <disfmarker> It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept . Okay . Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . Wha but what would be <disfmarker> one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? Well th You can get a lot more information on it . to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control . So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes
Okay . So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept .
Okay . Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept .
Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay .
Yeah . Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh <vocalsound> to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the <disfmarker> so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted <disfmarker> so they want to um <disfmarker> they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .
We are targeting T_V_ . <vocalsound> We need <vocalsound> we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have <disfmarker>
or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . With a good shape for the <disfmarker>
Mm-hmm . And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ <vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . So the com the um <vocalsound> the uh <vocalsound> the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology .
So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , <vocalsound> it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . <vocalsound> I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point Excellent .
Mm-hmm . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . It is up to you to go through this um <vocalsound> uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh <disfmarker> well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible . and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . Um uh we <disfmarker> we don't go for speech recognition technology .
So <disfmarker> so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? <vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop You just say channel fifty , and that's it . I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know . But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .
'Cause otherwise we need <disfmarker> because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh Uh <disfmarker> of increasing the unit price . What would be <disfmarker> You just say channel fifty , and that's it . I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know . But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , Means th yeah twenty five Euros is <disfmarker> yeah , that's right . Well this is what we need to find out . it's <disfmarker> Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
Yeah . I dunno . <vocalsound> Just made a quick design . <vocalsound> Yes . So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them <disfmarker> <vocalsound> oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . Uh development one . <vocalsound> Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , Sound . so I don't expect that to be a problem . Yeah yeah uh uh . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um <disfmarker> Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . So um that kind of gets you this ratios . Kind of this this look . <vocalsound> Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours
And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . Uh development one . <vocalsound> Uh well I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , Sound . so I don't expect that to be a problem . Yeah yeah uh uh . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um <disfmarker> Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . So um that kind of gets you this ratios . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls .
No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . Mm . <vocalsound> Alright . So <vocalsound> I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . Yeah . Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . <vocalsound> Yeah . And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . Mm-hmm . So um <vocalsound> for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um <vocalsound> I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . Yeah . Uh the case materials . Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah , <vocalsound> maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use <gap> the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um <disfmarker> Yeah maybe we <disfmarker> Okay . I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . Yeah . And it's more fun . Yeah , just playing with it Yeah . and <disfmarker> especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , S yeah it's safe . Uh go ahead . 'Kay next . So double curved is like this , this , this , or <disfmarker>
And rubber . Rubber material . Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left . Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . No . Uh the case would be doubly curved . So <disfmarker> Rubber material .
Yeah . Can we uh <disfmarker> One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that . So okay . Just <disfmarker> yeah . I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . Yeah . So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . Yeah with the programme . But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? Both . For for everything , also for the advanced options ? Okay . yeah um <disfmarker> Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . <gap> <vocalsound> you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . Yeah . Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . That would be the back . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . Mm-hmm . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous <disfmarker> so that's an a also an option . Um that was it .
Yeah . <vocalsound> Exactly . Exactly . Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? Yeah that would be an option . I think the <disfmarker> I mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I would go for the double curved . Okay . And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . Yeah I'd agree . but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . Well this is really your decision but <disfmarker> If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that . Yeah . That would be a nice way to use it but <disfmarker> I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that <gap> that you can able to use in one hand I think . Different . So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have <disfmarker> Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . <gap> . A little upwards . So that the screen is more Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . Yeah I understand what you mean . That's uh that's <disfmarker> How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . If you can uh flip . So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive . So and you want to be able to Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . Yeah And the menu button also because when you flip it open <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . Oh <disfmarker> Activate and th the <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . Why ? it's not very uh very strong uh <disfmarker> yeah if you drop it one time <gap> . True . It uh c it can go open . Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . If you cover it with rubber . Exactly . Exactly . Yeah . So it can bounce . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> Yeah yeah . Mm-hmm . And ergonomical shape . Yeah . I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . Anyway . They have LEDs but they have a colour . <vocalsound> Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . Yeah ? You know kind of thing . Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . Okay . you can use the button option <disfmarker> Yeah . So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? And <disfmarker> but then I w I would <disfmarker> Okay . I think . Okay . Yeah . Alright . I think that uh it's a nice design . Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . <vocalsound> So red buttons are okay ? I think so . Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . Yeah . <gap> or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? <vocalsound> Yeah I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? we could make <disfmarker> Like some soft <vocalsound> green or something ? Orange or something . Or <disfmarker> and then <disfmarker> Or blue ? Dark blue or <disfmarker> Oh yeah yeah , dark blue and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , <vocalsound> an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , We should use <disfmarker> maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? with very uh bright tones I guess . Mm . Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . So you have something like <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . If you we uh <disfmarker> yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , <vocalsound> Y <vocalsound> So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . Yeah . Oh <disfmarker> Some yellow . Yeah with some some yellow banana <disfmarker> Banana colour . <vocalsound> the you know that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . Yeah ? So it <disfmarker> not not only in in the colours <vocalsound> of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or <disfmarker> Who ? I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? Yeah . Yeah . Why not ? <vocalsound> Aye . Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . No . Uh the case would be doubly curved . So <disfmarker> Rubber material . And rubber . Rubber material . Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left . So just just a <vocalsound> a blue blue backlight or something like that . Yeah . As long as you loo <vocalsound> use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . is that is that the advanced chip ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Advanced chip . Okay . Wow . So that people with uh with Alright . Kinetic . Double curved . I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , Too <gap> . Yeah I don't know . I didn't get any information about that so <disfmarker> <gap> . Blue . Maybe green . But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Yeah you can <disfmarker> Ooh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . Mm . Yeah . But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or <disfmarker> Yeah that that w Yeah . This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . Oh yeah . Yeah sure . <vocalsound> It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . This is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . Oh okay . I see . That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . exactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And <disfmarker> Yeah . But it has also to <disfmarker> it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So <disfmarker> It ha <gap> . The children's story . Yeah I've got it . Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , Distinction . Yeah . 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And <disfmarker> Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , Yeah . The colour <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with <gap> LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . you know , with the <disfmarker> If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . Mm-hmm . So you can't <gap> change the colour so <disfmarker> You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . Okay . bit of light and attention . what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . Bit of feedback . Ah yeah bright colours . Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh <disfmarker> And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . Yeah . Okay . That should be nice . Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort . A compromise between what ? Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . So s
And you two uh are going to do this . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Don't mean to discourage you but <disfmarker> uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so <disfmarker> Ah , right . So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? Look-and-feel and <disfmarker>
Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation <disfmarker> you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , Alright . And the <disfmarker> You will do the evaluation . Of the product ? Yeah I don't know . Oh okay . <vocalsound> You probably get a mail . Or you you or you send it to me . because you are going to design it on this board right ?
Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . No .
And rubber . Rubber material . Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . No . Uh the case would be doubly curved . So <disfmarker> Rubber material .
Advanced chip . Okay . Wow . is that is that the advanced chip ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah .
<gap> I'll just put it in there . So , he's coming . <gap> . <vocalsound> I did get a bit more done than the last time , Or not . Okay . Oh okay . 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . Move to meeting room . <vocalsound> Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , Yeah . Oh . and also with <disfmarker> I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . Yeah me too , <gap> .
No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . Mm . Uh go ahead . 'Kay next . So double curved is like this , this , this , or <disfmarker>
Alright . Kinetic . Double curved . I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , Too <gap> . Yeah I don't know . I didn't get any information about that so <disfmarker> <gap> .
Yeah . <vocalsound> Exactly . Exactly . Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? Yeah that would be an option . I think the <disfmarker> I mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I would go for the double curved . Okay . but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . Well this is really your decision but <disfmarker> Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . Okay . That should be nice . Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort . A compromise between what ? Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . So s
Yeah I understand what you mean . That's uh that's <disfmarker> How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . If you can uh flip . So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive . So and you want to be able to Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . Yeah And the menu button also because when you flip it open <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . Oh <disfmarker> Activate and th the <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . Why ? it's not very uh very strong uh <disfmarker> yeah if you drop it one time <gap> . True . It uh c it can go open . Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . If you cover it with rubber . Exactly . Exactly . Yeah . So it can bounce . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? we could make <disfmarker> Like some soft <vocalsound> green or something ? Orange or something . Or <disfmarker> and then <disfmarker> Or blue ? Dark blue or <disfmarker> Oh yeah yeah , dark blue and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , <vocalsound> an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , We should use <disfmarker> with very uh bright tones I guess . Mm . Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . So you have something like <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . If you we uh <disfmarker> yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , <vocalsound> Y <vocalsound> So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . Yeah . Oh <disfmarker> Some yellow . Yeah with some some yellow banana <disfmarker> Banana colour . Who ? I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? Yeah . Yeah . Why not ? <vocalsound> Aye . So just just a <vocalsound> a blue blue backlight or something like that . Yeah . As long as you loo <vocalsound> use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? So that people with uh with Blue . Maybe green . But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Yeah you can <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or <disfmarker> That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . Yeah yeah . They have LEDs but they have a colour . <vocalsound> Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . Yeah ? Okay . I think . So red buttons are okay ? I think so . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with <gap> LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . you know , with the <disfmarker> If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . Mm-hmm . So you can't <gap> change the colour so <disfmarker> You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . Okay . bit of light and attention . what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . Bit of feedback .
Close the the window . Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . So <disfmarker> That's right . Ruud . Um project kick-off . Is there a schedule for this meeting ? Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud . I shall close the door . yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um we're here to develop uh a new product . Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ? Okay . Um <vocalsound> we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . Alright . Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? There is ? Yeah , there is . Okay . <vocalsound> No problem . <vocalsound> Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . <vocalsound> Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . Okay . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um <vocalsound> we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the <gap> <disfmarker> the the progressions , yes . Progressions . <vocalsound> Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific <disfmarker> uh specification of that . Um <vocalsound> the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think . It's for the vision . Yeah . Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .
Just use this one uh during the day . <vocalsound> Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . But we all use the same white-board file Yes . I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um <vocalsound> to um <disfmarker> oh well , I'm <disfmarker> I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training <vocalsound> um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . Okay . An animal . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh a wee rabbit . It's a bunny . <vocalsound> Okay , well great . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? <vocalsound> But of course , Flores . But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Blank . <vocalsound> Yeah . right ? Okay ? <vocalsound> Beautiful . <vocalsound> Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions <disfmarker> well , just just let me know . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it <disfmarker> keep it with the functional design . <vocalsound> Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . <vocalsound> Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um <vocalsound> to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . <vocalsound> Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh Sensors . sensors , so do not grab it here , Um well , it <disfmarker> it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um <vocalsound> you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file .
back to our project . Um <vocalsound> the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development ,
I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh <vocalsound> is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . But <disfmarker> Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . Mm-hmm . But it's cost-effective . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so Yes . Or you shou sh use a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss Yeah . and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , Yeah . but take these things into account when you start the discussion . Okay , because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh <vocalsound> Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . but <disfmarker> well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . Okay . I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device <disfmarker> diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . And for a cell phone ? Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . Yeah , okay .
Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . Okay . Okay . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Okay . Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . <vocalsound> Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um <vocalsound> how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Mm-hmm . Um so let's start with you . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Mm-hmm . And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . Because ? Do do you <disfmarker> Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the <disfmarker> such a product ?
devices ? Yep . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um <disfmarker> Yeah uh , what is it ,
So that's it . Um but furthermore <disfmarker> And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . Or are there any o other controls ? Are there only <disfmarker> any other cont Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or <disfmarker> Well , <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . Yeah . Uh-huh . You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch <disfmarker> They're very vu vulnerable . w yes , Yeah . to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . I don't know . Yeah . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , Mm-hmm . so you must <vocalsound> point everywhere , so maybe infrared is <disfmarker> Okay . Maybe not even pointed . Yeah , just don't even point it , Yeah . so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . Mm-hmm . are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or <disfmarker> yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in <disfmarker> outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . okay . Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . Okay , s yeah . Yeah . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um <vocalsound> in dark too . So when it's dark <disfmarker> Those are two really uh user interface <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . <vocalsound> And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . Because ? what he said about pointing . Mm-hmm . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So <disfmarker> we'll probably have to implement that . Okay . Um <disfmarker> oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um Yeah . uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Yeah . Well , maybe I um <disfmarker> but it it can be quite simple , I I don't know . you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . Mm-hmm . Okay . The uh the the digits in black . Mm-hmm . Uh then it's already visible in dark . Okay . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy <vocalsound> <disfmarker> well , it can be for design , of course . Okay . Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . Okay , okay . Okay . Very good point . Yeah . You have a m uh <disfmarker> Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .
twelve Euro fifty , yeah . So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . So <disfmarker> Yeah ,
Hmm . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's use uh a lot of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , Well does it ? well <disfmarker> I know it from the cell phone . I'm not sure . Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's <disfmarker> it seems to work uh quite okay . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So uh technically it will be possible . But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . No , you cannot . Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily Mm-hmm . Okay . um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or <disfmarker> But um <disfmarker> Yeah .
But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . No , you cannot . Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . Does it <disfmarker> Um Okay . <vocalsound> so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it . Okay . See you in thirty minutes . Great .
Um Okay . <vocalsound> so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes
<vocalsound> Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals ,
back to our project . Um <vocalsound> the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .

devices ? Yep . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um <disfmarker> Yeah uh , what is it ,
<vocalsound> Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . Yes , I think it should be something like that . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , No , okay .
<vocalsound> Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . Yes , I think it should be something like that . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ? Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not <disfmarker> we're we're <disfmarker> it's not a <disfmarker> Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh <disfmarker> We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? don't have the information for it . No . No . <vocalsound> Well , I'll give it a try . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . right ?
twelve Euro fifty , yeah . So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . So <disfmarker>
Hmm . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's use uh a lot of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , Well does it ? well <disfmarker> I know it from the cell phone . I'm not sure . Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's <disfmarker> it seems to work uh quite okay . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So uh technically it will be possible . But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . No , you cannot . Okay . <vocalsound> So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or <disfmarker> But um <disfmarker> Yeah .
So well uh welcome everyone . Yeah . Um as you may have noticed I uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . Yeah . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . Didn't we just do that ? Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . Oh . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , Oh , sorry . and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? <vocalsound> Yes , you are . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Yep . Yep . Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , Oops . <vocalsound> We first start with the overall uh <disfmarker> This is about the total remote control . View . We made it green . Just example colour , so uh Yeah . there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , Okay ? Any questions so far ? <vocalsound> Big microphone . <gap> yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Yeah . Oh y you <disfmarker> perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Of course . Hmm . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Mm . Mm , th yeah . Small . Okay um <vocalsound> we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um <gap> <disfmarker> You push the scroll button Yeah , you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . Remote settings , et cetera . Yeah . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see <disfmarker> Yes . Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh <disfmarker> which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh <disfmarker> Yes . In an apart uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . okay . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . Would you like to make any comments about next uh <disfmarker> Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but <disfmarker> It's the button where you can switch channels . <gap> just when you are one and you go to two , you can <disfmarker> or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's quite large . <vocalsound> It's <vocalsound> it's a bit big . <vocalsound> And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext . Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh <disfmarker> uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh <disfmarker> And I just missed when I was typing <disfmarker> The R_R_ stands for ? <gap> That's the logo of the <disfmarker> Logo , okay . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Yeah . uh <disfmarker> uh , yeah . Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh <vocalsound> yeah . tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Heavier Then I'll move this one . Didn't we just do that ? Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops . Yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> Everything you loaded was also Uh . Yeah , everything worked . It's now half past four <disfmarker> half past three , so <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . <gap> wants to , but at least this one . Yeah , but it's <disfmarker> it isn't a picture Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? No . <vocalsound> No , isn't possible . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , Yeah , and and use the the the scroll thing as a <disfmarker> with your fingers . Evaluation . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we <gap> <disfmarker> requirements from the <disfmarker> of the users . My name , my job , The methods . <vocalsound> Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . Right . One means absolutely not true , seven <gap> <disfmarker> means true . Yeah . you used the PowerPoint <gap> <disfmarker> is the remote control fancy enough , Yeah . is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . Yeah . First question . Is the design fancy enough ? Well <disfmarker> Project Manager , what do you think ? Well it's <disfmarker> looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , <vocalsound> Yeah . huh ? Yeah . Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? <vocalsound> Now uh It uh <disfmarker> oh it's in the background . Oh . the single curved idea was uh <disfmarker> So it works . it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ? That's not very <disfmarker> i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , so that it lays a bit o Yeah . Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? <gap> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think <disfmarker> Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . I think it does . I think so . I think <disfmarker> I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . It's pretty fancy . <vocalsound> Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , <gap> you get th Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Yeah . <gap> It's true , it's a one . <vocalsound> Very fancy . Huh ? Alright , it's a one . <vocalsound> Oh it's a one . <vocalsound> No , it's a two . <vocalsound> Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? Yeah , Yeah . It's very true , Yeah , I think two . because we designed it to be very fancy , so <disfmarker> It's very fancy , I think . We should perhaps <disfmarker> Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay well , Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ? I think it is , Enough . because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . Yeah m And uh uh the scroll is rubber , We have for the search function . True . Also huh uh-huh <disfmarker> the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . <vocalsound> Yeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . Well , I think they are . The options are it <disfmarker> uh little bit harder , Yeah . It's easier than the regular uh remote control . easy t Yeah , Yeah , I think this is easy now . and you use these buttons the most , I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to huh ? Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what <disfmarker> which sign or icon means on uh every button . Oh . Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . Yeah . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most <disfmarker> So And why is that ? we have two , two , three . I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You you can touch options . Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? You can touch options and it's comes out . A two , okay , Yep . Okay , next question . It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . For young people I think it's easy to use . <gap> Young means sixteen to forty years . Yeah , I was <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In the entire mankind . you're very enthusiastic about your own design , Also if you're sixty years old <disfmarker> Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , You want these options to <disfmarker> Also As well for the for the older people ? Yeah , as well Uh sure . as your <disfmarker> if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , No , right ? but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , So <disfmarker> And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? so it it it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , but so they could <disfmarker> Uh I think it is . If they read a manual . Because that might <disfmarker> Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . Uh because a lot of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , Channel one , channel four , yeah . then you say the question and the answer . <vocalsound> And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . Yeah . Two and a half . <vocalsound> Okay , a three , I see . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Another question . Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . No . No . No . No , that that's that's <disfmarker> But um I mean , yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . that's definitely one . A false , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , It's not overwhelmed . a one , because we designed for that , Remote control has uh colours that different <disfmarker> that meet different target groups . huh ? Yes . <vocalsound> <gap> 'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . is optional . That's true . Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Huh . can't you ? Also with rubber ? Uh I think you can . It it feels like rubber , You can make a print on rubber , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's a one ? Okay . Yeah , it is it is harder to we have time . <vocalsound> Geez . Yeah , but we have <disfmarker> We also <disfmarker> We have to get to the money . <vocalsound> We're getting paid . We're getting paid . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The material used is spongy , <vocalsound> What ? that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber . What <gap> spongy . Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Uh . Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing . but not <disfmarker> it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . Yeah , it's a three , Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah . because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , Hard but <disfmarker> You can <vocalsound> break it . Remote control is hard to lose . Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Y yeah , you could you could call it . Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh <disfmarker> set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally . Two . That it's hard to lose ? No . Yeah , it it is <disfmarker> there's the <disfmarker> Isn't hard to lose . Yeah , it's a six , you think ? <vocalsound> It does have an <disfmarker> a built in function . Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands <disfmarker> Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . So it should <disfmarker> this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . Nee . Hard to lose . Oh right . Yeah , this this is hard to lose . It is hard to lose . Yeah , <vocalsound> so then this is <disfmarker> it is almost true , This <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Whoa . Ooh . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's okay . <vocalsound> Okay okay okay . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . Click . True . I think it will , Yeah ? Uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Uh well No , I don't think very true because the colours . There . I don I think So ma uh make it make it a two . I think it's a three . Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , Yeah . Yeah , I think it's a two perhaps not . What did <disfmarker> Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Yeah . Well Well , that <disfmarker> it doesn't . n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , <vocalsound> Yeah bu but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> but it's for a remote control I think it i <vocalsound> it would satisfy those needs . I think they like the speech . Yeah , the speech possibility , You could call to your uh <disfmarker> L_C_D_ screen and scroll . yeah , and the screen , I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . No . It has relatively few features , those are features . It's three features , basically , with <disfmarker> the L_C_D_ <gap> touch screen is feature . Yeah . The microphone is a feature . No , aren't the features <disfmarker> the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . Personally , uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the <disfmarker> you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Yeah . We like two . <vocalsound> Right . You can see the remote control is <gap> R_ and R_ . Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh . Yep . <gap> Has <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . oh yeah , do did have <disfmarker> nah y you have the black one . Yeah . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Yeah , Yeah . but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Maybe two . but the logo is on on the front , Okay , true , yeah . X_ marks spot . <vocalsound> that's <disfmarker> And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . <vocalsound> I think it is , but I don't know what you think . <vocalsound> I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , Yeah , tha that's so true . because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . Mm-hmm . No , I'm not not convinc . <vocalsound> Let's start over again then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Menu . I think it would be a t yeah , two . <vocalsound> We m mostly have twos , So two , yeah . The average is a two . so it's pretty good . Yeah . <vocalsound> Sure . we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . No , it's two . The average is two . but it did already <gap> Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . The number of <disfmarker> No , uh count uh number of functions , one battery , with two small batteries . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do Yeah , yeah . Yeah , so this one and this one . single curved is like this . Um rubber indeed ? Yeah , Is he integrated ? No , eh ? I don't know . Push button . Yeah , No , we don't have push button . Eighteen and a half , Yeah , damn . We have to lower it with six points . Damn . No , Okay . But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh <vocalsound> with uh the button . Yeah , alright . Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . It's four pri it four units . Yeah , but if you <disfmarker> would i we don't exactly need the single <disfmarker> We don't need a curve . But w d wha No , 'S possible to lose curve . Curved then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . We would lose this one ? Yeah , but tha that that only is one . Yeah , okay . Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . No , two . No , one . So we still <disfmarker> Yeah , we also have to <disfmarker> Is it possible to make <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . We changed th and <disfmarker> Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . but it's just one Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Yeah , but it's t Yes , four points . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special . Or can't you ? Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the <disfmarker> Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult . <vocalsound> Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We could make it titanium instead of rubber . <vocalsound> You don't make a remote control of <disfmarker> Ah . Yeah , it it i Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah , it also <disfmarker> uh it also takes one point less . Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , What ? Yeah . Yeah , but it's only a half . But m yeah , course , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we we scrap that one ? Don't make it wood . A colour . Yeah , but a wood <disfmarker> Make it uh <disfmarker> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? Normal colours , yellow <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You don't say here's green rubber . They don't sell green rubber plants . <vocalsound> Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . And then you can <vocalsound> and then you can add to the colours . Yeah , two colours <gap> it . Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Yeah , but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . Yeah . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red , we we also want to make ano another colour . Oh right , yeah . Yeah , Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Yeah , because we have more colours than only black . That's what it means . Yeah , Yeah . Add it copy page . Select all . No , but you c The microphone . Yeah , and that's it . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? Yeah , I tried to copy that one , you can draw over it with white uh pen . <vocalsound> Yeah , we tried it earlier . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . And erase the mic . Yeah , goodbye mic . Oh , no <gap> . No , Hey , add <gap> <disfmarker> but you can erase that . Yeah , that's a bit weird . <vocalsound> Hmm , strange . No , <vocalsound> Yeah . And you could ask things . Yeah , something he said <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? probably to simulate the whole working uh process , Yeah . Yeah , but then you can work together too It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase Yeah , or it doesn't uh <disfmarker> So you can draw uh <disfmarker> see it over th on the screen . Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , Th the pen doesn't <disfmarker> The line is a bit off . Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . Yep . Alright . Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be . I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , Yeah , I used it to y to <disfmarker> huh ? Yeah , it did work pretty well . I don't think why you would want to use it actually , Yeah , No <disfmarker> it is easy for <disfmarker> to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . Right . Yeah , With some things that was only problem , but that was <disfmarker> it was our assignment , Yeah , but <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Well . Yeah , or the room for <disfmarker> in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . No , the first one . No , w I didn't know <disfmarker> Yeah , I didn't know uh <disfmarker> we would have gotten uh more information . Mm-hmm . Yeah , Yeah , more information about the costs .
<vocalsound> Yeah . uh <disfmarker> uh , yeah . Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh <vocalsound> yeah . tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Heavier Then I'll move this one . Didn't we just do that ? Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops . Yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> Everything you loaded was also Uh . Yeah , everything worked . It's now half past four <disfmarker> half past three , so <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . <gap> wants to , but at least this one . Yeah , but it's <disfmarker> it isn't a picture Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? No . <vocalsound> No , isn't possible . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , Yeah , and and use the the the scroll thing as a <disfmarker> with your fingers . Project Manager , what do you think ? Well it's <disfmarker> looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , <vocalsound> Yeah . huh ? Yeah . Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? <vocalsound> Now uh It uh <disfmarker> oh it's in the background . Oh . the single curved idea was uh <disfmarker> So it works . it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ? That's not very <disfmarker> i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , so that it lays a bit o Yeah . Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? <gap> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think <disfmarker> Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . I think it does . I think so . I think <disfmarker> I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . It's pretty fancy . <vocalsound> Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , <gap> you get th Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Yeah . <gap> It's true , it's a one . <vocalsound> Very fancy . Huh ? Alright , it's a one . <vocalsound> Oh it's a one . <vocalsound> No , it's a two . <vocalsound> Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? Yeah , Yeah . It's very true , Yeah , I think two . because we designed it to be very fancy , so <disfmarker> It's very fancy , I think . We should perhaps <disfmarker> Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay well , Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ? I think it is , Enough . because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . Yeah m And uh uh the scroll is rubber , We have for the search function . True . Also huh uh-huh <disfmarker> the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . <vocalsound> Yeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . Well , I think they are . The options are it <disfmarker> uh little bit harder , Yeah . It's easier than the regular uh remote control . easy t Yeah , Yeah , I think this is easy now . and you use these buttons the most , I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to huh ? Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what <disfmarker> which sign or icon means on uh every button . Oh . Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . Yeah . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most <disfmarker> So And why is that ? we have two , two , three . I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You you can touch options . Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? You can touch options and it's comes out . A two , okay , Yep . next question . It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . For young people I think it's easy to use . <gap> Young means sixteen to forty years . Yeah , I was <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In the entire mankind . you're very enthusiastic about your own design , Also if you're sixty years old <disfmarker> Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , You want these options to <disfmarker> Also As well for the for the older people ? Yeah , as well Uh sure . as your <disfmarker> if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , No , right ? but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , So <disfmarker> And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? so it it it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , but so they could <disfmarker> Uh I think it is .

No , that that's that's <disfmarker> But um I mean , yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . that's definitely one . A false , yeah . Yeah .

What <gap> spongy . Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Uh . Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing . but not <disfmarker> it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . Yeah , it's a three , Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah . because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , Hard but <disfmarker> You can <vocalsound> break it . Remote control is hard to lose . Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Y yeah , you could you could call it . Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh <disfmarker> set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally . Two . That it's hard to lose ? No . Yeah , it it is <disfmarker> there's the <disfmarker> Isn't hard to lose . Yeah , it's a six , you think ? <vocalsound> It does have an <disfmarker> a built in function .

Ooh . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's okay . I think it will , Yeah ? Uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Uh well No , I don't think very true because the colours . There . I don I think So ma uh make it make it a two . I think it's a three . Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , Yeah .

Right . You can see the remote control is <gap> R_ and R_ . Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh . Yep . <gap> Has <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . oh yeah , do did have <disfmarker> nah y you have the black one . Yeah . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Yeah , Yeah . but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Maybe two . but the logo is on on the front , Okay , true , yeah . X_ marks spot . <vocalsound> that's <disfmarker> And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . <vocalsound> I think it is , but I don't know what you think . <vocalsound> I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , Yeah , tha that's so true . because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . Mm-hmm . No , I'm not not convinc . <vocalsound> Let's start over again then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Menu . I think it would be a t yeah , two . <vocalsound> We m mostly have twos , So two , yeah . The average is a two . so it's pretty good . Yeah . <vocalsound> Sure . we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . No , it's two . The average is two . but it did already <gap> Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . The number of <disfmarker> No , uh count uh number of functions , one battery , with two small batteries . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do Yeah , yeah . Yeah , so this one and this one . single curved is like this . Um rubber indeed ? Yeah , Is he integrated ? No , eh ? I don't know . Push button . Yeah , No , we don't have push button . Eighteen and a half , Yeah , damn . We have to lower it with six points . Damn . No , Okay . But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh <vocalsound> with uh the button . Yeah , alright . Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . It's four pri it four units . Yeah , but if you <disfmarker> would i we don't exactly need the single <disfmarker> We don't need a curve . But w d wha No , 'S possible to lose curve . Curved then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . We would lose this one ? Yeah , but tha that that only is one . Yeah , okay . Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . No , two . No , one . So we still <disfmarker> Yeah , we also have to <disfmarker> Is it possible to make <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . We changed th and <disfmarker> Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . but it's just one Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Yeah , but it's t Yes , four points . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special . Or can't you ? Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the <disfmarker> Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult . <vocalsound> Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We could make it titanium instead of rubber . <vocalsound> You don't make a remote control of <disfmarker> Ah . Yeah , it it i Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah , it also <disfmarker> uh it also takes one point less . Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , What ? Yeah . Yeah , but it's only a half . But m yeah , course , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we we scrap that one ? Don't make it wood . A colour . Yeah , but a wood <disfmarker> Make it uh <disfmarker> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? Normal colours , yellow <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You don't say here's green rubber . They don't sell green rubber plants . <vocalsound> Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . And then you can <vocalsound> and then you can add to the colours . Yeah , two colours <gap> it . Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Yeah , but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . Yeah . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red , we we also want to make ano another colour . Oh right , yeah . Yeah , Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Yeah , because we have more colours than only black . That's what it means . Yeah , Yeah . Add it copy page . Select all . No , but you c The microphone . Yeah , and that's it . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? Yeah , I tried to copy that one , you can draw over it with white uh pen . <vocalsound> Yeah , we tried it earlier . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . And erase the mic . Yeah , goodbye mic . Oh , no <gap> . No , Hey , add <gap> <disfmarker> but you can erase that . Yeah , that's a bit weird . <vocalsound> Hmm , strange . No , <vocalsound> Yeah . And you could ask things . Yeah , something he said <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? probably to simulate the whole working uh process , Yeah . Yeah , but then you can work together too It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase Yeah , or it doesn't uh <disfmarker> So you can draw uh <disfmarker> see it over th on the screen . Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , Th the pen doesn't <disfmarker> The line is a bit off . Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . Yep . Alright . Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be . I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , Yeah , I used it to y to <disfmarker> huh ? Yeah , it did work pretty well . I don't think why you would want to use it actually , Yeah , No <disfmarker> it is easy for <disfmarker> to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . Right . Yeah , With some things that was only problem , but that was <disfmarker> it was our assignment , Yeah , but <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Well . Yeah , or the room for <disfmarker> in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . No , the first one . No , w I didn't know <disfmarker> Yeah , I didn't know uh <disfmarker> we would have gotten uh more information . Mm-hmm . Yeah , Yeah , more information about the costs .
Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , Yeah . and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , Yeah . and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , So we're going to erase features or something . but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . I doubt it . Oh shit . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . Yeah mm yeah , maybe . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , The microphone . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . if it doesn't work <disfmarker> this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , I want to fill it in , but uh <disfmarker> The number of <disfmarker> No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay <disfmarker> Oh okay . Well Ah , okay , cool . and there are different screen shots , so <disfmarker> or different different screens , I dra No it took a battery ? A battery . One battery , We'll wait . <vocalsound> Hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have <disfmarker> advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . On advanced chip . Uh we ha we have um single <disfmarker> Oh , we already on nine . what ? Are we ? We have double curved . <vocalsound> The single . Single nee single curved . Single . With a scroll wheel , right ? Rubber . Yeah . Push button . Yeah , No , we don't have push button . we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , oh , too bad . <vocalsound> Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ? But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . Oh , we don't have any buttons , so <disfmarker> Eighteen and a half , Yeah , damn . we need to uh We have to lower it with six points . Damn .
so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , And the rest is the same , huh ? Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Am I right ? Tap . Okay , but this this new remote we can afford . <vocalsound> It doesn't work . When did you receive this list ? I just received it . Ah okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh ignore that . <vocalsound> They don't work so hard at the finance department . <vocalsound> Ah okay . Okay . Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . It didn't work . Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now Evaluation drops . we don't have any buttons , so <disfmarker> Eighteen and a half , Yeah , damn . we need to uh We have to lower it with six points . Damn . oh , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We could lose the curve . Nah . We could use <disfmarker> Yeah , I would lose the curve . We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh <vocalsound> with uh the button . Yeah , alright . I think that will be our best bet . So normal scroll wheel ? Normal scroll wheel . And I think we should lose the curve . I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Lose <vocalsound> <disfmarker> then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just <disfmarker> we also have to <disfmarker> Is it possible to make <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . No ? No . so maybe you should should uh <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , And then you can keep the curve . it is something special . that's difficult . <vocalsound> Yeah . Or make it on a hand dynamo , but <vocalsound> I don't think that will work . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? <vocalsound> We could make it titanium instead of rubber . <vocalsound> You don't make a remote control of <disfmarker> Ah . Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ? yes ? Yeah . Is that the wood uh wood uh <disfmarker> I think it is . this , we have to have that one too ? Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah . Sample speaker . To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . Th then we still have too much Yeah , okay , if we use the uh <disfmarker> three . Point three . But m yeah , course , What we'll have . <vocalsound> Huh ? Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . <vocalsound> Point twelve <gap> . See , a po three . <vocalsound> We need point three . <vocalsound> That's a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . A colour . but a wood <disfmarker> Make it uh <disfmarker> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah , is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? special colours , fruity colours . It's also green Normal colours , yellow <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Yeah . s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Then we have two . touch . yeah . <vocalsound> then it's possible to make . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or <disfmarker> How d uh uh how many colours ? What do you mean ? Yeah , but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , Ah okay . Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , I suppose . b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red , and then you add <disfmarker> you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Nee but isn't it per remote that you pay ? I <disfmarker> then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special <disfmarker> Oh right , yeah . Half ? Is it per remote ? I think you pay half per remote . Yeah . Yeah , that's right , So each remote with a special colour . and you <disfmarker> So then it is one . You don't need four of those <vocalsound> uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . Nee one point . we have um advanced chip on print . One . <vocalsound> So it would be curved , single curve . Because of <disfmarker> thing <disfmarker>
actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Yeah . I think we got it already . Heavier um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops . Yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh . Faster laptop . they're pretty heavy . Uh . They were they were just fine . But that's not really uh <disfmarker> And furthermore the the the network was okay . Yeah . av available there . Right . And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , So <disfmarker> Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Huh . and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . And erase the mic . Station page . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . Huh , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ? Deadlines were sometimes very short . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Bu but stressful . But <disfmarker> You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . And stressful . Yeah . I think we <disfmarker> it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Yeah . Now we worked through each other , Yeah . you had information I didn't have yeah , and then uh <disfmarker> and you had information I also had , Oh right . <vocalsound> so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , Yeah . So yeah , that <disfmarker> I don't think that is the best way to work at <disfmarker> for such project . Yeah . No . So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . <vocalsound> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Yeah . Yeah , you could <disfmarker> Why should we be separated from each other in those difference <disfmarker> uh different rooms ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , I think so too . probably to simulate the whole working uh process , Yeah . when <disfmarker> Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , Huh , oh right . I don't think that was the best way , but <disfmarker> But the technology was uh fantastic . <gap> Yeah , the technology's okay . Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think <vocalsound> . Perhaps it is e It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase Yeah , or it doesn't uh <disfmarker> perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh <disfmarker> and lay it next to that keyboard over there . Yeah . So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful <vocalsound> It's useful , but not m Yeah , it is useful , but <disfmarker> it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . No . Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . Th the pen doesn't <disfmarker> The line is a bit off . Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . Yep . you can point to where you want the line to be . But <disfmarker> The project uh <disfmarker> because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh <disfmarker> have , you didn't have time to uh <disfmarker> to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . Yeah . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the <disfmarker> Uh <vocalsound> so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? I <disfmarker> I didn't use it at all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I used it , it it was <disfmarker> you can use it , it's quite handy I think . Yeah , well huh ? Yeah , it did work pretty well . I used it too , it is very easy . yeah , it is easy for <disfmarker> to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . But to write it th yeah . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write . It doesn't really write normally . Okay , um and what about the teamwork ? Team work was okay . I think it was great , Yeah . Yeah , well I think so too . yeah . Only thing that we worked through , past each other . <gap> we <disfmarker> Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I thought it was good , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . yeah , no prob . Ah . Yeah Okay . And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , <vocalsound> Yeah , or the room for <disfmarker> it was the idea to be creative , There was room for <disfmarker> and this what came out . And you get get stuff from the from the computer , Yeah . but <disfmarker> The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Yeah . it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah . Is it on there ? I didn't find the <disfmarker> didn't look but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> At some times I <disfmarker> Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , Oh right , I didn't look , but <disfmarker> No , I I never got that . and then <disfmarker> <gap> I got like one email after ten minutes or something . I always <disfmarker> That's what we said . <vocalsound> So does this <disfmarker> I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , And it <disfmarker> not a lot uh <disfmarker> like I <disfmarker> with with the remote <gap> and I never new we have t we had to uh <disfmarker> yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Make a r yeah . nee . And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , Yeah , so <disfmarker> So , yeah . <disfmarker> but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . Yeah . When we get uh <disfmarker> when we have <disfmarker> we would have gotten uh more information . Mm-hmm . Yeah , Yeah , more information about the costs . Faster .
actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Yeah . I think we got it already . Heavier um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops . Yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh . Faster laptop . they're pretty heavy . Uh . They were they were just fine . But that's not really uh <disfmarker> And furthermore the the the network was okay . Yeah . av available there . Right . And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , So <disfmarker> Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Huh . what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ? Deadlines were sometimes very short . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Bu but stressful . But <disfmarker> You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . And stressful . you had information I didn't have yeah , and then uh <disfmarker> and you had information I also had , Oh right . <vocalsound> so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , Yeah . I don't think that was the best way , but <disfmarker> But the technology was uh fantastic . <gap> Yeah , the technology's okay .

Yeah . When we get uh <disfmarker> when we have <disfmarker> we would have gotten uh more information . Mm-hmm . Yeah , Yeah , more information about the costs . Faster .
Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um <disfmarker> well
<vocalsound> celebration , well , for the three of you , Champagne . <vocalsound> because uh I have to write the final report now .
No it took a battery ? A battery . One battery , We'll wait .
so Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah . Sample speaker . we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , No . so maybe you should should uh <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .
right ? <vocalsound> Hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have <disfmarker> advanced chip ,
So it works . it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ? We have double curved . Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? <vocalsound> Now uh It uh <disfmarker> oh it's in the background . Oh . the single curved idea was uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The single . Single nee single curved . Single . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , And then you can keep the curve . it is something special .
With a scroll wheel , right ? Rubber . Yeah .
touch . yeah . <vocalsound> then it's possible to make . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . And the rest is the same , huh ? Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Am I right ? if you lose uh <vocalsound> if you lose the <disfmarker> It was such a great idea . <vocalsound> You lose this one , you got eleven point five They can add two colours .
Any questions so far ? <vocalsound> Big microphone . <gap> yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Yeah . Oh y you <disfmarker> perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Of course . Hmm . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Mm . Mm , th yeah .
uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the <disfmarker> you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Yeah . I think it will , Yeah ? Uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Uh well No , I don't think very true because the colours . There . I don I think So ma uh make it make it a two . I think it's a three . Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , Yeah . but not <disfmarker> it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . Yeah , it's a three , perhaps not . What did <disfmarker> Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Yeah . Well Well , that <disfmarker> it doesn't . n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , <vocalsound> Yeah bu but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> but it's for a remote control I think it i <vocalsound> it would satisfy those needs . I think they like the speech . Yeah , the speech possibility , You could call to your uh <disfmarker> L_C_D_ screen and scroll . yeah , and the screen ,
<vocalsound> Sure . we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . No , it's two . The average is two . Add it copy page . Select all . No , but you c Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , No , right ? The number of <disfmarker> No , uh count uh number of functions , No . No , that that's that's <disfmarker> advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? No . <vocalsound> No , isn't possible . Oh , no <gap> . No , Hey , Is he integrated ? No , eh ? <vocalsound> Hmm , strange . No , <vocalsound> We have to lower it with six points . Damn . No , Okay . we don't exactly need the single <disfmarker> We don't need a curve . But w d wha No , 'S possible to lose curve . Curved then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . No , two . No , one . Is it possible to make <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , that's <disfmarker> It has relatively few features , those are features . It's three features , basically , with <disfmarker> the L_C_D_ <gap> touch screen is feature . Alright , it's a one . <vocalsound> Oh it's a one . <vocalsound> No , it's a two . <vocalsound> Yeah . The microphone is a feature . No , aren't the features <disfmarker> the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay well , But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . No , the first one . No , w I didn't know <disfmarker>
So normal scroll wheel ? Normal scroll wheel . And I think we should lose the curve . I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Then it would just <disfmarker> Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , oh , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We could lose the curve . Nah . We could use <disfmarker> then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . And then you can keep the curve . it is something special .
But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah , but it's only a half . Normal scroll wheel . And I think we should lose the curve . I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Lose <vocalsound> <disfmarker> No . so maybe you should should uh <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Yeah . Sample speaker .
is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? special colours , fruity colours . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , That's a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . A colour . but a wood <disfmarker> Make it uh <disfmarker> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah ,
Then we have two . touch . yeah . <vocalsound> then it's possible to make . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . if you lose uh <vocalsound> if you lose the <disfmarker> It was such a great idea . <vocalsound> You lose this one , you got eleven point five They can add two colours . See , a po three . <vocalsound> We need point three . <vocalsound> That's a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> Uh it's a colour . because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? special colours , fruity colours . It's also green Normal colours , yellow <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Yeah . But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or <disfmarker> How d uh uh how many colours ? What do you mean ? Yeah , but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , Ah okay . Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , I suppose . b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red , and then you add <disfmarker> you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Nee
'Kay . Alright . I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um <disfmarker> Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . <vocalsound> Users think they're ugly . Um <vocalsound> they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um <vocalsound> they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay .
No . <vocalsound> Alright . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . N not used anymore . there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that .
Um and and also there's <disfmarker> so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um <disfmarker> And I think <disfmarker> and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control <gap> in your room . It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible .
Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? Yeah . Yeah . Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So <disfmarker> No so it's a text file n in the project folder . But you you've got more information than <disfmarker> uh . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . Okay one device . Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . Yeah ? And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . Below ? so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity . Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well . Present and the colours .
we have to to to watch out for the <disfmarker> i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable Mm-hmm . Content and form . Okay . Alright . I uh had uh two examples . Mm-hmm . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . Mm-hmm . This the easy one Yeah . I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . Yeah . Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . So we <disfmarker> Okay so so we have the option for more functions . So not not too much but <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . Mm . Yeah . Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . Yeah Yeah . so maybe you can hide them or something . Yeah . and then the basic function just on the device itself . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . Mm-hmm .
did I break it ? <vocalsound> What <gap> . So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ? For for the advanced functions I think . Yeah that's what we make it up . it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . No . Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . So not not too much but <disfmarker> yeah . Um <disfmarker> yeah . And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech <disfmarker> And the speech recognition yeah . Yeah okay it's handy .
Yes . Okay . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And well the info on the website which came too late . Mm-hmm . Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . <vocalsound> So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . Okay . I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um <vocalsound> the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , Mm-hmm . which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . Yeah frequency . Yeah . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ Yeah decoder . and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um <disfmarker>
And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . Yeah . Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So is <disfmarker> you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are <disfmarker> Uh you can make a <disfmarker> if you make a drawing . Yeah . The remote , yeah ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . Basic . Is on top . Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . Yeah . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . You you need to be able to hold it so <disfmarker> Those are both both <disfmarker> multifunctional . Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . yeah . Yeah . That's very good idea . Oh five minutes . Well we have those buttons . We use all four . No <disfmarker> The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry Yeah okay go ahead . Yeah ? sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . Yeah . Yeah . So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . And one back . But it should be <disfmarker> if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , On the left uh top yeah . I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . Yeah . And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . But um <disfmarker> Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . Yeah okay but <gap> only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Normal for logical t Okay we put it on top . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo Yeah . Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so <disfmarker> True . Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . Yeah . Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . Never mind . but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Volume . Yeah . That's uh that's a good one . Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? Yeah . Yeah programming . Uh so we have sound , So channel programming ? yeah ? Channel programming . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . L_ s Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . S swap channels ? Can I call it that ? Yeah . Swap channels . Swap's good option . Okay . <vocalsound> Work harder . <vocalsound> Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Whatever .
So we need two menus kind of thing . Yeah But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . Yeah We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . Yeah . you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . Uh-huh . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . Yeah with the chip and then <gap> I mean <disfmarker> Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . L_ s
Mm-hmm . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . And then finally say okay , exit . And those can also be used for the menu . Yeah exactly . I thought <disfmarker> but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . Yeah . And you you have <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , Yeah okay . For the menu . Yeah . and then if you press it you <disfmarker> the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon
and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . Yeah .
Um <disfmarker> The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function Yeah k kind of structure into layers . The the layout of the remote control ? <gap> . and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the <disfmarker> Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? So but <disfmarker>
<gap> . Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . Maybe more on <disfmarker> No I d I think that's more in <disfmarker>
So not not too much but <disfmarker> yeah . That's the the one with the <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> yeah . And the speech recognition yeah . And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech <disfmarker>
You can navigate . That's the the one with the <disfmarker> Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . L_ s
'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . Yeah ? And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . Below ? Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to <disfmarker> the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . Okay . So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? Uh sixteen to forty . Yeah .
'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . N not used anymore .
'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . Okay one device .
but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . Mm . And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity . Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well . Present and the colours .
So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo Yeah . Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so <disfmarker> True . Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . Yeah . Okay we put it on top .
multifunctional . Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . yeah . Yeah . That's very good idea . Oh five minutes . Those are both both <disfmarker>
How do I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You pressed alt F_ four ? <vocalsound> No no no . I pressed the mouse button . Oh great . <vocalsound> Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but <disfmarker> Yeah pretty much . Hey what's wrong with my computer ? Okay . Oh right . Uh <disfmarker> I think you have to uh change your desktop uh <vocalsound> or is there some pressing issue ? Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . Oh no pressing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size . <vocalsound>
Yes . Okay . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And well the info on the website which came too late . Mm-hmm . Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . <vocalsound> I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . Yeah wa wa you actually <disfmarker> Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so <disfmarker> Mm .
Yeah . Form function okay . <vocalsound> I think that's a that's a good separation . Okay . because w he already knows what <disfmarker> Yeah we have to kind of work together . Yeah . and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the <disfmarker> Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? <gap> . I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . Okay . So he's layout and you're function .
