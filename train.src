<vocalsound> Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . Um <vocalsound> I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form Sorry . so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as <disfmarker> in addition to their existing remote controls . Um <vocalsound> and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . Um . <gap> Now uh uh
mm that it it gets lost . Um . <gap> Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um <disfmarker> the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll <disfmarker> Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh <disfmarker> I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer <disfmarker> they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um <vocalsound> the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um now this doesn't <vocalsound> necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm <vocalsound> uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh
Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the <disfmarker> our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um <vocalsound> everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are <disfmarker> how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly <vocalsound> . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um <vocalsound> they they don't uh <disfmarker> they , yeah , they only use <disfmarker> they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh <disfmarker> I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . <vocalsound> Uh again , seventy five percent is <disfmarker> seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just <disfmarker> they use it a lot , <vocalsound> And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like <disfmarker> well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the <disfmarker> uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very <disfmarker> aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . I dunno Mm . maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate <gap> , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is <disfmarker> Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new <disfmarker> like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use <disfmarker> have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice <disfmarker> the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . Mm . <vocalsound> But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would <disfmarker> if people would pay more for speech recognition <vocalsound> <gap> and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our <disfmarker> on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , Yeah , I must say that um the uh <disfmarker> I c can't remember what <vocalsound> um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um And uh <vocalsound> it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a thought Yeah , um <disfmarker> oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? it's a bit <gap> . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . is used the most . So
So m we can maybe even start to cut down on <disfmarker> or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , Mm . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I mean <disfmarker> and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily <disfmarker> It could be <disfmarker> oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones so you could have the most <vocalsound> used buttons on top Mm . Mm . Yeah , like the one that like slides back Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? and the buttons are concealed underneath . Yeah . Mm . If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um <vocalsound> remove them altogether . Just remove them completely ? That might be the <disfmarker> We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um <disfmarker> I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the <disfmarker> the the age structure we were looking at <disfmarker> um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now Uh yeah . do we know whether they <disfmarker> Forty <disfmarker> no sorry <disfmarker> for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . <vocalsound> um well again , we don't know the relative proportion <disfmarker> the relative numbers in the age groups . Yeah , that's true . If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ <disfmarker> It might <disfmarker> Or even <disfmarker> I mean you could even just have it left on . You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ Maybe i and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . well it <disfmarker> I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , Mm . No . because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , <vocalsound> B_B_C_ one . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> so it probably needs to be um <disfmarker> possibly actually need a button on it Yeah , that's true . just to activate it . Oh yeah . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then <disfmarker> but they are quite important when they're used . w we need to s identify things that <vocalsound> people actually need Yeah . and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , Stand out . Um . So <disfmarker> if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's <gap> the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . Do , please . Uh you were saying about um it could <disfmarker> technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . we could maybe have like an activation word . you address the computer , and then give it a command . if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm , yeah . device itself . Um . I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . S carry on . Do you want to just carry on with <disfmarker> Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the <disfmarker> or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . <gap> alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since <disfmarker> if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd <disfmarker> it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . Mm-hmm . S s we could <disfmarker> we could make it dual function <gap> voice recognition and <gap> still have buttons on it um <vocalsound> Oh , we could , yeah .
it's going . <vocalsound> Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . Alright . So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are <disfmarker> what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So these are the two different ones . This one um <disfmarker> this is the user centred , <vocalsound> it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , Mm-hmm . that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you <disfmarker> it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a <disfmarker> you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , Mm , yeah . then that would be easier . Um <vocalsound> and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was <disfmarker> when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it <disfmarker> maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .
Oh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . <vocalsound> Oh there we go . Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and it does this uh by <disfmarker> well , you need <disfmarker> to start off you need an energy source <vocalsound> and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is <disfmarker> that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um <disfmarker> Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , <vocalsound> uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um <disfmarker> oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source And so my personal preferences <disfmarker> I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface <vocalsound> um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily .
Mm . <gap> before we um <disfmarker> I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . Mm . Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . <vocalsound> Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one <disfmarker> some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time <disfmarker> I mean when all's said and done , the digital television <vocalsound> will be taking over in that time scale . Um Mm . Mm-hmm . uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh <disfmarker> Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? Yeah , Um it's , you know , it's <disfmarker> what it saves in cost and you know there there's a <disfmarker> well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it <disfmarker> It could have like uh <disfmarker> know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . Yeah . <vocalsound> I would think that people might forget <disfmarker> I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , <gap> and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um . 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . yeah , <gap> so uh um yeah . <vocalsound> what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? Yeah , think that's a good idea . Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah . No . manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . Do they make batteries that last that long ? I mean Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , <vocalsound> They usually have the little light uh <vocalsound> source , but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example . I dunno what the heck they're called , Yeah , they have that little solar <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> but In in fact I'd <disfmarker> Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , Yeah , uh uh <disfmarker> so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . Mm . I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating Mm . I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . Oh , then they're clicking a lot , yeah . <vocalsound> W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight n Oh , I must admit I hadn't um <disfmarker> I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive . But then again , if you think it <disfmarker> of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like <disfmarker>
but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the <disfmarker> I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if <disfmarker> clearly only need the main functions . Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and <vocalsound> there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <vocalsound> Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? So uh <disfmarker> Oh <vocalsound> Yeah . We are doing just the television . I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing <disfmarker> so not D_V_D_ players , No . we okay , okay . I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , Mm . <vocalsound> Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed . um <disfmarker> right , so I'd <disfmarker> I need to sum up very quickly here um . <vocalsound> We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um ,
Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .
Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now ,
Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer <disfmarker> they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um <vocalsound> the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm <vocalsound> uh is is is their choice , um <disfmarker> right , so I'd <disfmarker> I need to sum up very quickly here um . <vocalsound> We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape .
<vocalsound> Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional <disfmarker> in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can <disfmarker> that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as <disfmarker> I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , I'd <disfmarker> I need to sum up very quickly here um . <vocalsound> We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um ,
but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the <disfmarker> I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for <disfmarker> i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a <disfmarker> you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else . <vocalsound> Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , But , since <disfmarker> if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd <disfmarker> it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . Mm-hmm . S s we could <disfmarker> we could make it dual function <gap> voice recognition and <gap> still have buttons on it um <vocalsound> Oh , we could , yeah . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um ,
because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if <disfmarker> clearly only need the main functions . Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . well it <disfmarker> I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , Mm . No . because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , <vocalsound> B_B_C_ one . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> so it probably needs to be um <disfmarker> possibly actually need a button on it Yeah , that's true . just to activate it . Oh yeah . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then <disfmarker> sorry to interrupt . Do , please . Uh you were saying about um it could <disfmarker> technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . we could maybe have like an activation word . We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um <disfmarker> I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the <disfmarker> Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change .
yeah , <gap> so uh um yeah . <vocalsound> what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? Yeah , think that's a good idea . Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah . No . manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . Do they make batteries that last that long ?

Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and <vocalsound> there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <vocalsound> Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was <disfmarker>
This is our conceptual design meeting . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um <vocalsound> and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um Um and that they often lose the <disfmarker> it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would <disfmarker> wanna make it simple . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um <disfmarker> And that it should look different than what's out there . Um <disfmarker> Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um <disfmarker> Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , <vocalsound> which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um <disfmarker> I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <vocalsound> And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay
Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . <vocalsound> Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel .
Cust you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Personalise your remote . personalised , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and <disfmarker> Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? That's what I was thinking yeah .
Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .
You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . <vocalsound> So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a <disfmarker> Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there <disfmarker> has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a <vocalsound> possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know <gap> if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the <disfmarker> do it <disfmarker> or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't <disfmarker> it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like <gap> gets more and more compli complicated .
And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version . <vocalsound> Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um <vocalsound> I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex So the ru wait the rubbery <disfmarker> we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ? <vocalsound> With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , 'Kay . but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . Mm . But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . <vocalsound> You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . <vocalsound> May fail though , every here and there . Would you have to leave it by the window ? exactly . Yeah . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . <vocalsound> So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . Um <disfmarker> However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however <vocalsound> when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . So um <disfmarker> There's also restrictions <vocalsound> to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . <vocalsound> The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really <gap> top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um <disfmarker> So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . <vocalsound> Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and
Yeah . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any <disfmarker> they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? S Certainly can be done yes . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The fruit design um <disfmarker> How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , Mm . but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . You name it . So that's <gap> thing if we did it yellow .
Um <disfmarker> ow . Ow . So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ? Well we sort of <disfmarker> <gap> rid of that because <gap> gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary . Oh right okay . Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , Yeah . And what kind of supplements we'll have . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . Right . And we have five minutes . Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be <gap> as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with <disfmarker> Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . Yeah . M more of a l lamination perhaps . <vocalsound> Yeah . So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? Yeah I think so . I think <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? Yes . It does .
Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Here's what's gonna be going on . Um <disfmarker> Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um <disfmarker> Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .
Here's what's gonna be going on . Um <disfmarker> Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um <disfmarker> Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . Right .
Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . Right . Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
Right . Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> maybe and and get us a prototype . <vocalsound> Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that <vocalsound> basically <gap> just be working on the prototype , <vocalsound> uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . <vocalsound>
You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . <vocalsound> So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . And what kind of supplements we'll have . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . Right .
<gap> as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with <disfmarker> Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . Yeah .
M more of a l lamination perhaps . <vocalsound> Yeah . So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? Yeah I think so . Yeah ? I think <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? Yes . It does .
Yeah . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any <disfmarker> they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? S Certainly can be done yes . So that's <gap> thing if we did it yellow .
they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? S Certainly can be done yes . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The fruit design um <disfmarker> How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , Mm . but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . You name it . is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . But <disfmarker> mm . I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . <vocalsound> <gap> . Um <disfmarker> I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . <vocalsound> A banana shape ? Oh it was sort of banana shaped . <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . <vocalsound> So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups .
Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be I think <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? Yes . It does .
Yeah . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any <disfmarker> they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? S Certainly can be done yes . <gap> as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with <disfmarker> Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . So that's <gap> thing if we did it yellow .
If you're all ready . Yeah . So <gap> is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 'Kay . individual work and a meeting . Tool training . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . Okay . Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . <vocalsound>
Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . Market range internationally sold . Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be <disfmarker> can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . Ah right okay . and and what we would <disfmarker> roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody . Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . Okay . You want it big do you want it small . Medium . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like <disfmarker> there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , <vocalsound> Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . Maybe you <disfmarker> now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . Yeah . 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , <vocalsound> Mm . but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . But how do we know how much uh , 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these <disfmarker> any of these ideas are feasible or not . Right . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . Yeah . Um . Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? <vocalsound> Like so you have one in like <disfmarker> mm into one . So it's not <disfmarker> you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . <vocalsound> So you just flip them out . Okay . Um <gap> have uh one very complicated one on one side with <vocalsound> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <vocalsound> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <vocalsound> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like <vocalsound> what is the mute button . I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold <disfmarker> like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but <disfmarker> Oh okay . Like it <gap> or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <vocalsound> Yeah . what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate Yeah . D_V_D_ players , things like that . I have got <disfmarker> I think we should also have a back-up plan of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that <disfmarker> I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . Yeah . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just <disfmarker> that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , Yeah . uh simple to use , and looks decent and <disfmarker> May w you know , maybe even <disfmarker> But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people I mean if it's if it's just like <disfmarker> or so people that uh b don't see very well or <disfmarker> big buttons for <disfmarker> touchy buttons for <disfmarker> Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but <vocalsound> that's not gonna happen . <vocalsound> I think a flip up thing , <vocalsound> so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , Yeah .
there you go . <vocalsound> So <gap> <disfmarker> User Interface Designer , that's that's That's me . Okay . that's you , so you gotta <gap> you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . Right . Right . Industrial Designer , you are the one <gap> , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's <gap> what goes into the box , somehow . Mm . Har how it works an And in marketing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> These are requirement specification . Bu User requirements specifications . So what the user requires Yeah , Do you think our two kind of overlap , because <disfmarker> in a remote . what <disfmarker> Right , okay , yeah . Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . I guess that's what it says . You two <vocalsound> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you <disfmarker> working together . Yeah . Yeah . You're the one that's gotta go and find out <disfmarker> do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .
Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .
Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . Market range internationally sold .
selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . Market range internationally sold . Yeah .
Production cost , ah right it's gotta be <disfmarker> can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . Ah right okay .
so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , Yeah .
what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate Yeah .
D_V_D_ players , things like that . I have got <disfmarker> I think we should also have a back-up plan of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that <disfmarker> I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . Yeah . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just <disfmarker> that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . Yeah .
and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these <disfmarker> any of these ideas are feasible or not . Right . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . Yeah . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate Yeah . D_V_D_ players , things like that . I have got <disfmarker> I think we should also have a back-up plan of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that <disfmarker> I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . Yeah . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just <disfmarker> that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . But how do we know how much uh ,
So you just flip them out . Okay . Um <gap> have uh one very complicated one on one side with <vocalsound> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <vocalsound> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <vocalsound> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like <vocalsound> what is the mute button . I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold <disfmarker> like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but <disfmarker> Oh okay . Like it <gap> or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <vocalsound> Yeah .
so it will end at four twenty five . Okay . Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . Um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . <vocalsound> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time .
Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation . Ta-da . Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . <vocalsound> Ah . This is the one that I made . Uh-huh . It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter <disfmarker> takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television <gap> . 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 'Kay . Um as for what it's actually made of <disfmarker> well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <vocalsound> in the different menus . Okay . Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? <vocalsound> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just <disfmarker> if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . <vocalsound> Also with on off switch and infrared <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh <disfmarker> well , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one <disfmarker> or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the <disfmarker> uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we Mm-hmm . Well colour , I think <disfmarker> I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . <vocalsound> So , and if I'm <disfmarker> yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case <disfmarker> that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a <disfmarker> quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n A banana . banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like <disfmarker> yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and <vocalsound> Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? <vocalsound> Hold them , Yeah . <gap> I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the Breaking , you know <disfmarker> Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . Hmm . It's really kind of a <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . And it's a very simple design , It's texting . you know , this is really identifiable . <vocalsound> I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean actually how to program the menus Mm-hmm . and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , Mm-hmm .
what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one <disfmarker> or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the <disfmarker> uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So A banana . banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like <disfmarker> yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . Yeah . <gap> I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the Breaking , you know <disfmarker> Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . <vocalsound> Ah . This is the one that I made . Uh-huh . It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter <disfmarker> takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television <gap> . 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 'Kay . Um as for what it's actually made of <disfmarker> well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <vocalsound> in the different menus . Okay . Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? <vocalsound> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold .
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . <vocalsound> Also with on off switch and infrared <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh <disfmarker> well , Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just <disfmarker> if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,
<gap> uh we need somebody to develop that . Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna <disfmarker> instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that <disfmarker> 'cause I have to do an average . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Right . And then um excess buttons . Just putting no excess buttons . Exactly . be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . As for <disfmarker> see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . Mm-hmm . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <vocalsound> Or L_C_D_ . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these <disfmarker> um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here <disfmarker> if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . I think we're good . how about if I uh pass this back to you Yep . and I'll uh figure out the average here . Right . Thank you for everyone's help with that . Right . <vocalsound> Try again . Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . Mm , yeah , price . Hmm . We'll put price up at the top . <vocalsound> Not that we actually know anything about it , <vocalsound> Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and <disfmarker> which <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I'd call these quite uh minimalist , Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . simple and plain , but I mean I do see what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , Mm-hmm . in that respect <disfmarker> I think we'll go with that respect . I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , Yeah . no these aren't the exact terms that the um <disfmarker> <gap> like stylish or aesthetic . Yeah . we'll just call it fancy then . Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps <disfmarker> and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow I think we n we need to <disfmarker> they're both <disfmarker> they're both yellow with black buttons , Yeah . it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . Mm . Yeah . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two Yeah . that isn't <disfmarker> that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , As a banana . I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . so . Yeah . And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk . The chunk . So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , No , we have to evaluate one of them . Unless <disfmarker> do you guys wanna evaluate both ? I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . <vocalsound> Yeah , I'd <disfmarker> It's more true than false , about a two . Okay . So we say true . <vocalsound> technologically innovative . <vocalsound> I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . Yeah . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . So we'll say <disfmarker> we'll say uh false . Easy to use . Very . Yes . <vocalsound> One , is that inappropriate ? Oh , pardon me . Um Trendy . trendy , s <vocalsound> and I say specifically spongy fruity . Oh yes . Mm-hmm . Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific <disfmarker> We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . Hmm . I think <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so but <disfmarker> two ? Um Yeah . Excess buttons . are there excess buttons ? No . No . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That is false . So that's false . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . True . Ugly . No . <vocalsound> No . something people <disfmarker> Yeah , I think they're different , like oh , Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . aren't they ? I like it . yeah . Yeah , I do too . It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . Oh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the <disfmarker> Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? Yeah , with the energy . If it's <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . Yeah . yes . Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . Okay . Yes , the instinct says true . So true one or should I go to two or three ? Okay . I dunno , I would say maybe a two , what do you <disfmarker>
I can give you a number , Oh um it's uh <disfmarker> Uh-huh . the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine <disfmarker> we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , To maintain old technology , exactly . Mm-hmm . which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , Yeah , yeah .
No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 'Kay . And the buttons <disfmarker> Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? Uh they'll be rubber , yep . like the compass point one . Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic . 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . Okay . it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . <vocalsound> Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay . Well , just kinetic then , <gap> . Yeah . we only need one . Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple <disfmarker> Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . Okay , and we only need one of those . Yep . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it <gap> single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . isn't it ? Um do we have What does double curved mean , I don't understand . And that's I I think you <disfmarker> it means you reverse the curve . uh that's the the one that goes like this . you can do a banana in single curve , Single-curved , I'd say . yeah . Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . I <vocalsound> I just wanna say plastic . We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ? One , two , three , four , five , six . I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , Yeah . but it depends on the cost , I guess . Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are .
We're in . <vocalsound> That's us . More profit . Great . Uh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . What , we're in .
Yes . Yeah . Easy to use . Very . Yes . <vocalsound> One , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , Yes . go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , Sure . Yeah . teamwork , Yes . means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . <vocalsound> And Play-Doh . Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . <vocalsound> So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . Yep . Um did we find any new ideas ? I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I <disfmarker> that really opened my eyes . Yeah . <vocalsound> Spongy . as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Yes . Yep . I I only speak for myself though . And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , <vocalsound> Yeah . so . Good work as a design team , <vocalsound> Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . because we <disfmarker> I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . So Are the costs within the budget ? Oh yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Yes . Yes . I can give you a number , and it's kept us within budget . so . Yes . isn't it ?
Alright . <gap> . And we've therefore <disfmarker> we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present ,
Alright . <gap> . And we've therefore <disfmarker> we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present ,
And we've therefore <disfmarker> we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .
Mm . <vocalsound> it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . Yeah . Well , just kinetic then , <gap> . Yeah .
Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple <disfmarker> we only need one .
Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple
you can do a banana in single curve , Single-curved , I'd say . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it <gap> single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness .
I just wanna say plastic . We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ?
I just wanna say plastic . We had the special colour .
'Kay . No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .
'Cause I think they can be plastic . 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case .
that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , No , we have to evaluate one of them . Unless <disfmarker> do you guys wanna evaluate both ? I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm . Yeah . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two Yeah . that isn't <disfmarker> that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , As a banana . I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . so . Yeah . And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk . The chunk . So
Um do we have And that's you can do a banana in single curve , Single-curved , I'd say . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it <gap> single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . isn't it ? Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . What does double curved mean , I don't understand .
Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 'Kay . And the buttons <disfmarker> Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? Uh they'll be rubber , yep . 'Cause I think they can be plastic . One , two , three , four , five , six . I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , Yeah . 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case .
I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . do you wanna start ? Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . Um we have our colours not <disfmarker> are not fixed , but this is the general shape . you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push <disfmarker> if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if <disfmarker> uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato , Okay , um <disfmarker> The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . What <disfmarker> We call that one the rhombus , I could <disfmarker> The v the rhombus rhombus ? That's the rhombus , yep . Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select Yeah we turn it off . yeah . Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? Um not really , <gap> it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . Mm-hmm . Yeah . On off , that's a possibility , yeah . Okay . And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . <vocalsound> We have the five preset seeds <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . that's for your consideration as well , Let's pass . plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . Mm-hmm . We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . Mm-hmm . But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on <vocalsound> . Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?
I don't know if you picked up your email , Yeah . but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it <disfmarker> it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . Mm-hmm . So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss <disfmarker> But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . It's really <disfmarker> Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? I think it would be difficult technologically , I think <disfmarker> That's true , mm 'kay . and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . Mm-hmm . Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we <disfmarker> so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okay 'cause <disfmarker> well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um <disfmarker> I think it it's <disfmarker> it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity .
the mango <gap> put me over . Mm . That's a much more trendy than a potato <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What are <disfmarker> what's everyone's numbers ? Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . Mm-hmm . Yes . Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , and I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two . The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . Mm-hmm . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , Oh , but once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We we <disfmarker> I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , Okay , so but <disfmarker> in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still <disfmarker> Alright , we also said simplicity , <vocalsound> how w how well does it address just being simple ? Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . Right . Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . I'm <gap> give it a three I guess . I'll give it a two . Three . Alright , and fashionable ? It's totally fashionable . It's hot , <vocalsound> I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <vocalsound> I dunno . Three . One . And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? Just that it would se serve our audience . Mm-hmm . I think as long <disfmarker> if we offer in a <disfmarker> in at least three different colour arrangements . Um yeah , that's good . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So I'll give it a a two <gap> . Yeah , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . Shall we uh <disfmarker> Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . All of them should have R_R_ , <vocalsound> Sure . Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? do we w <vocalsound> like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . Oh So where <disfmarker> I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me <disfmarker> I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . Okay . It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , <vocalsound> Ooh . I kinda like it . That's hard to miss . It makes look more fruity as well . <vocalsound> I dunno . <vocalsound> There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . I like this one . Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? Variety of colours are nice . I like the idea of the <disfmarker> I think I'm leaning towards the potato . I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . Mm-hmm . The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? Potato . <vocalsound> I think so . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . Okay . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion . Yeah . What does <vocalsound> each of you <disfmarker> I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . Okay , Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . I dunno if any of them are fancy awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . Okay . Um functional . I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . Awesome , she said it was one . Okay . Um is it technologically innovative ? Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really <disfmarker> Well , the kinetic battery . <vocalsound> In the battery , that's it . kinetic battery is a big one , so . How many people would notice that , though ? Mm . they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . Mm . Just the material . I mean it's it's just <disfmarker> it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> Uh let's say two . Alright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I <disfmarker> it's spongy all the way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Give it a one . Yeah . I'd I'd give it a one . Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <vocalsound> ? <vocalsound> Uh um <vocalsound> . Well , is it gonna be yellow ? It it might be , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in <disfmarker> Yeah . We might wanna keep it yellow . um well if we <disfmarker> I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in <disfmarker> and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . <gap> Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? If we had a yellow <disfmarker> I think it it's <disfmarker> it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . Yeah . I think i it's kind of mangoey too . <vocalsound>
the mango <gap> put me over . Mm . That's a much more trendy than a potato <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What are <disfmarker> what's everyone's numbers ? Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . Mm-hmm . Yes . Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , and I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two . The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . Mm-hmm . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , Oh , but once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We we <disfmarker> I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , Okay , so but <disfmarker> in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still <disfmarker> Alright , we also said simplicity , <vocalsound> how w how well does it address just being simple ? Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . Right . Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . I'm <gap> give it a three I guess . I'll give it a two . Three . Alright , and fashionable ? It's totally fashionable . It's hot , <vocalsound> I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <vocalsound> I dunno . Three . One . And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? Just that it would se serve our audience . Mm-hmm . I think as long <disfmarker> if we offer in a <disfmarker> in at least three different colour arrangements . Um yeah , that's good . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So I'll give it a a two <gap> . Yeah , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . Shall we uh <disfmarker> Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . All of them should have R_R_ , So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion . Yeah . What does <vocalsound> each of you <disfmarker> I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . Okay , Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . I dunno if any of them are fancy awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . Okay . Um functional . I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . Awesome , she said it was one . Okay . Um is it technologically innovative ? Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really <disfmarker> Well , the kinetic battery . <vocalsound> In the battery , that's it . kinetic battery is a big one , so . How many people would notice that , though ? Mm . they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . Mm . Just the material . I mean it's it's just <disfmarker> it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> Uh let's say two . Alright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I <disfmarker> it's spongy all the way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Give it a one . Yeah . I'd I'd give it a one . Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <vocalsound> ? <vocalsound> Uh um <vocalsound> . Well , is it gonna be yellow ? It it might be , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in <disfmarker> Yeah . We might wanna keep it yellow . um well if we <disfmarker> I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in <disfmarker> and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . <gap> Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? If we had a yellow <disfmarker> I think it it's <disfmarker> it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . Yeah . I think i it's kind of mangoey too . <vocalsound>
Are the costs within the budget ? I <disfmarker> okay , Yes . that that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Now Did you say one , Rose ? Yes . Okay um , That <disfmarker> the Excel thing is pretty cool . Yes . Yeah , that is pretty neat . Lovely . Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , so let me exit out of this first . Okay . Hand dynamo . We're using kinetic battery , Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . Single . Simple , simple rather . Simple . Simple . Mm 'kay . Um the case . Uh uh uh double-curved . Guess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy . we just skipped by them . Well don't we need plastic , and <disfmarker> No , I guess it was rubber rather than latex . I mean the rubber . It was rubber and special colour , right ? Yeah , Uh well <disfmarker> we're using <disfmarker> we're gonna need at least two special colours . Special colours , isn't it ? Um . I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . Per <disfmarker> you know , we'll <disfmarker> like we'll have yellow and black . Is that two special colours ? Right . Alright . Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . we're doing push buttons . Yeah . And how many buttons do we have ? We have six . We've got five <gap> . buttons <disfmarker> oh , so um . So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? Well , So <disfmarker> Special form ? They're all kind of just push button , No , I think they're fine . right ? Yeah . Special material ? Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . Uh . Oh so maybe . Thirteen point seven . Oh oh . Yeah , what can we reduce ? Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . Mm , I kind of like the buttons . are we sure this is double-curved ? Maybe it's single-curved , We have no idea . I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . <vocalsound> It's single curved . It's single curved . but we have a simple chip , single curve , <vocalsound> case material is rubber and it's a special colour , Yeah . It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . No , okay , maybe not . I don't know what just happened . Now it's twelve . We <vocalsound> What was our target price again ? Twelve point five . Twelve point five . Hey hey . Twelve point five . So we're just just about there . So we're okay , I think . We're all set then . back to agenda . <vocalsound> Um are the <disfmarker> are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , they are . No , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . Yes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point
closing . Are the costs within the budget ? I <disfmarker> okay , Yes . that that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Now Um are the <disfmarker> are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , they are . Yeah . Did you say one , Rose ? Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , Yes . Okay um , um how how well I guess I led it , um the <disfmarker> how well we worked together as a team , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , Let's move on to the project evaluation . um the digital pens , the whiteboard . <vocalsound> Well . Okay . I felt very creative . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes . in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set <gap> and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got <gap> cost . I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . Um I think we worked together pretty well . Yeah . Yeah , I mean <vocalsound> if I'd had more market research on the <gap> fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . <vocalsound> No , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . Yeah . That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . Yes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? new ideas found ? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . Definitely . Yeah . Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . etcetera . That <disfmarker> the Excel thing is pretty cool . Yes . Yeah , that is pretty neat .
closing . Are the costs within the budget ? I <disfmarker> okay , Yes . that that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Now Um are the <disfmarker> are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , they are . Did you say one , Rose ? Yes . Okay um , Well . Okay . I felt very creative . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes . in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set <gap> and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got <gap> cost .

That <disfmarker> the Excel thing is pretty cool . Yes . Yeah , that is pretty neat .
Yes . Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three Yeah . which we hope um <disfmarker> yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . Yeah , Real Reaction . <vocalsound> I do like the Martian remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . Oh , that would definitely be my second choice . Mm . Although the tog toggle <vocalsound> That's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow <gap> <disfmarker> I would break it . <vocalsound> I would break it . It's cool . that's funny <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is <disfmarker> it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh Kind of looks like a penguin , like <vocalsound> with no eye <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Um . Anything else to say ? Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , Alright .
Um anybody have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? here you can you can view . what did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards . You can just see what's up . Takes a little while to get excited to load . That <disfmarker> the Excel thing is pretty cool . Yes . my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . Spongy . I learned a lot actually . Mm . Oh wow . I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . This one was cooler . Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and <disfmarker> I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this <disfmarker> you just need to talk about the case . I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result <vocalsound> . It's really interesting though . I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . Yeah . We had a lot of the um <disfmarker> I think . Yeah . otherwise the technology <gap> today was kinda cool . That was really neat how I got emails We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . and <disfmarker> Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me <vocalsound> 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . I think if you had a larger group <disfmarker> And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint Yeah . And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , Mm . 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . Mm-hmm . but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess . Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? Uh we we worked together , Yeah . um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , It was fun . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So well done with the management , I felt well managed . Oh thanks . I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , It's kinda fun . and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . Mm . And I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That happened to me all the time though . I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . Mm-hmm . But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points <gap> at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> you know what I mean , Yeah . like we we couldn't answer every single question . Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> Um but <disfmarker> And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of Yeah . Mm . Um . I'm a little <disfmarker> I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a <disfmarker> um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . Yeah . Just gonna make <disfmarker> I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . Oh . But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so <disfmarker> Yeah , I guess <disfmarker> How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting . Most of it , mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all <vocalsound> No , I don't think we need to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah . Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or <gap> . Oh I guess it is black , grey . Grey is better than black , I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , <vocalsound> that was a bit of a conflict .
The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? Potato . <vocalsound> I think so . I like this one . Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? Variety of colours are nice . I like the idea of the <disfmarker> I think I'm leaning towards the potato . I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . Mm-hmm .
Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we <disfmarker> so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okay 'cause <disfmarker> well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um <disfmarker>
we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . Shall we uh <disfmarker> Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . All of them should have R_R_ , Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? If we had a yellow <disfmarker>
I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in <disfmarker> and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . if we <disfmarker>
And how many buttons do we have ? We have six . We've got five <gap> .
what can we reduce ? Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . Mm , I kind of like the buttons .
are we sure this is double-curved ? Maybe it's single-curved , We have no idea . I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . <vocalsound> It's single curved . It's single curved .
<vocalsound> case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but we have a simple chip , single curve ,
case material is rubber and it's a special colour , Yeah .
I don't know if you picked up your email , Yeah . but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it <disfmarker> it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . Mm-hmm . So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss <disfmarker> But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . It's really <disfmarker> Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? I think it would be difficult technologically , I think <disfmarker> That's true , mm 'kay . and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . Mm-hmm . Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we <disfmarker> so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okay 'cause <disfmarker> well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um <disfmarker>
Yeah , it's okay . Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions .
it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um <disfmarker> Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , <vocalsound> About the get <disfmarker> And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . 'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy ,
I don't s uh know who's doing t Well , what <disfmarker> that's what you want <disfmarker> trying to say . Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and <disfmarker> we have to choose for novice user . Okay . Yes . So <disfmarker> Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy <disfmarker> the trends in the markets , Yes . and I don't know if there uh are any um <disfmarker> uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . <vocalsound> I haven't really found a conclusion like that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the <disfmarker> with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh <disfmarker> Design . but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , No . and I think they're <disfmarker> we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . <vocalsound> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements ,
but uh I got these two , No . and I think they're <disfmarker> we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . <vocalsound> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements ,
Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . We do we do got a market . Um , <vocalsound> three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Yes . So <disfmarker> Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .
Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy <disfmarker> the trends in the markets , Yes . and I don't know if there uh are any um <disfmarker> uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . <vocalsound> I haven't really found a conclusion like that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the <disfmarker> with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh <disfmarker> Design .
Yeah . It's alright . Um <disfmarker> Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um <disfmarker> yes . The working method um <vocalsound> there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Um , <vocalsound> three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . <vocalsound> Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got <disfmarker> we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um <vocalsound> an important thing here , Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh <disfmarker> consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found .
Um , <vocalsound> three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . <vocalsound> Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got <disfmarker> we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um <vocalsound> an important thing here ,
So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . <vocalsound> I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Yeah , but it is <disfmarker> it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Mayb no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Yes . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , <vocalsound> something else nice to know . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Well , then we <disfmarker> I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Two ? <vocalsound> That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . Well <disfmarker> It's impossible , I think . No way . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special <disfmarker> put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or <disfmarker>
So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . Yes . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , <vocalsound> something else nice to know . Two ? <vocalsound> That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . Well <disfmarker> It's impossible , I think . No way . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special <disfmarker> put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or <disfmarker>
No , okay , but we don't have to <disfmarker> uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . No . Uh maybe we <disfmarker> uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . The most standard batteries . I think I think that we should use uh d I think double A_ . Yeah ? <vocalsound> Uh ten twenty minutes . But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . <vocalsound> Well , uh these these shouldn't <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's <disfmarker> Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can <disfmarker> what the extra touch can be . Maybe th m Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or <disfmarker> Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . <vocalsound> I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh <vocalsound> ten to twelve or whatever . <vocalsound> Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or an <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> and I think it's gonna be uh very uh <disfmarker> it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . Yes . And use friendly , yeah . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . Yeah . Yeah , a swapable front or whatever . Yeah , or just different colours would be uh <disfmarker> I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . Well <disfmarker> <disfmarker> yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah . Yeah , you have to put it on its <disfmarker> So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . A face ? It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that . Yeah yeah , but <disfmarker> yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in <disfmarker> If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . That it's it's fashionable . <vocalsound> <gap> I <gap> I don't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . Oh , yeah . And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <vocalsound> A char <vocalsound> chargeable . Yeah . Why not . Maybe you , but <vocalsound> we don't know much about production cost , but when you <disfmarker> you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money <disfmarker> there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , <gap> rechargeable units . With recharger . Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could <disfmarker> when that's <disfmarker> when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , And then you <disfmarker> Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . No . On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still <vocalsound> still put a bleep function in it , <vocalsound> Yeah . Oh , if it <disfmarker> let's <disfmarker> well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . Yeah . It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo <gap> <disfmarker> I've experienced that that <disfmarker> So we've now had to <disfmarker> the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think we're we're looking for some <disfmarker> Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that <disfmarker> We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . <vocalsound> No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the <disfmarker> The new project requirements told us not to <disfmarker> It's n Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other <disfmarker> maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , <gap> No , you don't think so ? No , new requirements say no . Yeah , the new requirements say so . Mm , yeah . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh <disfmarker> Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh <disfmarker> dozens of of remote controls that have <disfmarker> Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not <disfmarker> nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . <vocalsound> Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it <vocalsound> quite often . Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And Will you look <disfmarker> I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , Yes .
Along the side uh strip of <disfmarker> yeah . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah . Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . Oh . Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . <gap> maybe put something on top of it <vocalsound> or , you know , like that's <disfmarker> looks funny . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> No . I don't know . Or some bump . I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . Maybe some <disfmarker> Yeah , probably , it would be nice . I dunno . Has anyone got um <vocalsound> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? <vocalsound> Do you get an idea of the shape ? I don't , for one . Maybe like this pen . A bit bigger I guess , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that . It has to feel nice in your hand . Well , I I <vocalsound> I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , that was a <disfmarker> would also be an idea , but I don't think it <disfmarker> I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . That would also be nice . But that's gonna <disfmarker> then you c then you don't Yeah , but <vocalsound> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it <disfmarker> that's not something i that's in the production cost <disfmarker> <gap> a one <disfmarker> it's a one time , you know <disfmarker> s was <disfmarker> it's a single cost . Would be a nice idea though . I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r <gap> it has to have round forms or something . Like something like that or so or so Something like that is very ergonomic . And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . So <disfmarker> Put it in there uh <gap> wire on it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . <gap>
Oh . Oh <vocalsound> okay , I'll make sure <disfmarker> I'll <disfmarker> I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see .
Well , there is some <disfmarker> oh . There is a closing sheet . We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . <vocalsound>
Y well , that <disfmarker> Uh ten twenty minutes . But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . <vocalsound> Well , uh these these shouldn't <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , okay . But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh <disfmarker> dozens of of remote controls that have <disfmarker> Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . <vocalsound> Yeah . But that's that's <disfmarker> Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can <disfmarker> what the extra touch can be . Maybe th m I think we're we're looking for some <disfmarker> Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions .
Oh , if it <disfmarker> let's <disfmarker> well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . Yeah . Uh , okay .

Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . Right . Uh well this is our design .
With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um <vocalsound> which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,
that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . You can see it also on the on the on the side view ,
but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . No I don't think <disfmarker> And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . And the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We thought about <disfmarker> Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . <vocalsound> And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Mm-hmm . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , Mm . uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . Yeah , it's a double R_ , but <disfmarker>
And the video button . The <disfmarker> Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round <disfmarker> I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . Oval yeah . Channel up and volume ? Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh <vocalsound> uh square buttons . and the <disfmarker> Alright . Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .
Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 'Kay .
<vocalsound> Well , this is just a short intro . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . Yes .
Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? F And you can also have <gap> front with uh with fruit on it . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's true . So the last one is seven . Easy to change channels ? Um , no it's uh <disfmarker> Is the material attractive ? But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? Well , no . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . <vocalsound> I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Yeah . Right . Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .
The sample speaker , Out . the s sensor . That's easy . Kick it out . Kick it out . The what ? Ah those <gap> those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . My god . It's just extra . Kick it out . So , zero . but it it's not good enough . <vocalsound> So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . The what ? The <disfmarker>
and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , Objection . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> project . <vocalsound> Well , <vocalsound> satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's uh <disfmarker> Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I agree . And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ? Well , alright . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Uh leadership <vocalsound> Terrible . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Leadership . Leadership ? Well <disfmarker> Well it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It was very democratic . <vocalsound> Uh yeah well <vocalsound> I think so also . and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . <vocalsound> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . <vocalsound> If you've <disfmarker> If you've <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright , teamwork ? Well <disfmarker> Well great I think . Right yeah . <gap> Yeah , think so too . Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? <vocalsound> It was a complete disaster . <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?
That's not uh the point <disfmarker> No but but <disfmarker> Well the the <disfmarker> Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but <disfmarker> Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils <disfmarker> Yeah well or a million people . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> let it be like this at uh at this moment . <vocalsound> Let it be .
The sample speaker , Out . the s sensor . That's easy . Kick it out . Kick it out . The what ? It's just extra . Kick it out . So , zero . The what ? The <disfmarker>
but it it's not good enough . <vocalsound> So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . Ah those <gap> those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?
If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But <disfmarker> Why ? Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?
That's not uh the point <disfmarker> No but but <disfmarker> Well the the <disfmarker> Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils <disfmarker> Yeah well
The sample speaker , Out . the s sensor . That's easy . Kick it out . Kick it out . The what ? It's just extra . Kick it out . So , zero . <vocalsound> Yeah . Then we go to fourteen point six . What more ? The what ? The <disfmarker>
But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . No , <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Oh , alright . <vocalsound> That's nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . Plastic is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh well we have to put that in . Yeah , we need to have the <vocalsound> the L_C_D_ screen . That that's a fact . Uh <disfmarker>
but I just got it . <vocalsound> Well that's pretty uh l Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , That is pretty stupid . <vocalsound> But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . I think <disfmarker> Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . Ah no no .
So we u we use uh <disfmarker> Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . Yeah , I agree . W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . We have a big financial problem . Well we make it more expensive to buy . Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on ,
Right yeah . <gap> Yeah , think so too . Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? <vocalsound> It was a complete disaster . <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?
But uh you can uh <disfmarker> I I sent it about three times now . Uh <vocalsound> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . Yeah . Yeah , it is .
Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um <vocalsound> remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no <disfmarker> we're not doing D_V_D_ , Okay . we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . <vocalsound> Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . <vocalsound> For reasons that I don't really know . There's <disfmarker> but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean
we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . <vocalsound> Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on <disfmarker> So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was <disfmarker> since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . Mm . The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , 'Kay . Fair enough . Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . 'Kay . Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits Fine . which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , <vocalsound> Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics 'cause we were thinking <disfmarker> that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , Right . It needs , yeah . you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .
<vocalsound> There you go . Sweet . Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Yeah Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh and know know what a normal remote control does . Um <vocalsound> now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well Oh yeah look at that . Mm . <vocalsound> but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions Mm-hmm . because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So my personal preferences . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . <vocalsound> Okay . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh <gap> . Great . Thank you very much Nathan . <vocalsound> Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .
this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort <disfmarker> like watching a hundred people <vocalsound> use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . <vocalsound> And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their <disfmarker> the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . <vocalsound> Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , <vocalsound> and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards .
'Kay . focus on um <vocalsound> uh presentation . Um <vocalsound> it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um Right . and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while <disfmarker> to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . Okay . any comments ? Thoughts before we break into <disfmarker> go into the next round of individual work on this . Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . Be interesting . Mm . What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um <vocalsound> And <gap> oh . logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said . W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Right , I dunno , what do you guys think ? Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . Yeah . Nice . That'd be okay . Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading Hmm . perhaps it could be like a temporary <disfmarker> Mm . Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . <vocalsound> Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . But apparently not . If it comes from above . People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . So . <vocalsound> They just want it to be on and ready to go . Yeah . that would help the battery life too and if it <disfmarker> the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Well Kind of if i all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Mm . or go into like a dormant mode . Goes into a sleep mode . There you go . <vocalsound> Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um <vocalsound> through you guys's presentations um <vocalsound> we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <vocalsound> Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , Oh right . <vocalsound> um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . <vocalsound> Yes . So maybe this <disfmarker> we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So Right . <vocalsound> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , Right . Um so um . How <disfmarker> th this voice operation thing is <disfmarker> I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Mm . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ <vocalsound> but we might be able to say um <vocalsound> volume up . Yeah . Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh . That could work . I like that . With a simple command like locate . Yeah . And then it could start to beep Something very basic . Oh yeah I think that's very doable . Okay . The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay It's a good point . If it's hidden under the couch <disfmarker> but then again you have this wee <disfmarker> this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . Mm . that'd be the technical thing Yeah . but <disfmarker> yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . <vocalsound> The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . True . and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . Right . <vocalsound> Yeah . I was thinking uh <disfmarker> Are we still thinking about this screen <disfmarker> sorry . Go ahead . The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Mm-hmm . 'S definitely an option technically . Okay . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , Okay . they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . We're doing okay . 'Cause it seems like an interesting option Okay . especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have Mm . <vocalsound> menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things Yeah . and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . Yeah . Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Mm-hmm . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with <disfmarker> I see <vocalsound> would there not be a <vocalsound> we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? <vocalsound> Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . Okay . Mm . Just the casing . Okay . We could have the casing , the the face plates . Okay . Back to the uh the cost <disfmarker> the material . <vocalsound> We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Right . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . Yeah Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , Mm-hmm . and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . <vocalsound> Alright well we can <disfmarker> we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . Yeah . yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um <disfmarker> Yeah yeah okay . Um <disfmarker> Interface ? Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally <disfmarker> let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have <disfmarker> Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . <vocalsound> Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ? Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Yeah . <vocalsound> So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years <vocalsound> even with the touch screen ? <vocalsound> I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple It is .
We're good ? Sounds good . I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . I've put my files in the shared folder as well . Brilliant .
Right . <vocalsound> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , <vocalsound> Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um <vocalsound> through you guys's presentations um <vocalsound> we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <vocalsound> Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions
Yes . So maybe this <disfmarker> we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them
s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um <disfmarker> Yeah yeah okay . Um <disfmarker> Interface ? Yeah I think that would be best . Let's as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> And we'll
Right . and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while <disfmarker> to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . Okay . Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh . That could work . I like that .

Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question .
Conceptual design meeting . Right . Okay , so <disfmarker> Right well um from the last meeting <vocalsound> I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . <vocalsound> Uh right , so <disfmarker> Wishing I hadn't closed the damn <disfmarker> Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often ,
basically the uh for the <disfmarker> Um I'll <gap> back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes <gap> including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . <vocalsound> There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up <gap> um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . Um that's one option , Mm-hmm . but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is <disfmarker> Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , Okay . which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal <disfmarker> for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel which is <disfmarker> you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s What would be the cost do do we know ? Um that's on the next <disfmarker> <gap> I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um which is the next section . Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just <disfmarker> see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . Mm-hmm . The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . Mm-hmm . Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it . Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . Mm-hmm . Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . But are we going f R
Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it . Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . Mm-hmm . Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . But are we going f R The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . Mm-hmm . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .
But are we going f R Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um . So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , Yeah yeah . so would it not be best to <disfmarker> rather than <disfmarker> I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation Um . Maybe w Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular <gap> and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time Um . Um yeah we should <gap> . <vocalsound> As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um . No the scroll wheel required the regular , so the <disfmarker> I think the scroll wheel um <disfmarker> The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . Um but that bit <disfmarker> And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . Down . Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? Mm-hmm . Right . Okay . 'Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the <disfmarker> So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . Okay . Simple push button . <vocalsound> <gap> Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um Mm-hmm . Yeah . So it is basically the concept we discussed before . <gap> Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . I'm guessing it would , but <gap> got like the definite information . Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than <disfmarker> So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? Or are we going for the regular ? Mm . Hmm . I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we <gap> m make a decision . But <disfmarker> But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , Right . it just <disfmarker> it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah . Mm-hmm . So maybe that would be something separate , yeah . So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . Yeah . No . Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . Yeah . Yeah . And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . Oh that makes sense . Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . Simple push button . Okay . W w kinetic . And it says that <disfmarker> You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . Um yeah I I thought so just for <disfmarker> just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . Mm-hmm . It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . Mm-hmm . So the speech recognition was <disfmarker> Are we going for speech recognition ? No ? did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . Just just for the call and find thing . It was just <disfmarker> Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah . And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . I assume it would cost extra , but <disfmarker> Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . <vocalsound> And then have to change all <vocalsound> change <gap> everything at the last minute .

Oh that makes sense . Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .
Um . <vocalsound> Oh , that was quick . Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . Um . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . <vocalsound> Okay , right . Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control Yeah , yeah . rather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . And there's no real advantage and <disfmarker> because it impacts on other <disfmarker> on the materials and the price it's not great . On the price , yeah . Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 'Kay . I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , <gap> maybe not , but <disfmarker> Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude <disfmarker> Hmm . The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a <disfmarker> You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . Hmm .
Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 'Kay . I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , <gap> maybe not , but <disfmarker> Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude <disfmarker> Hmm . The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a <disfmarker> You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should <disfmarker> Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . Hmm .
Okay . So not to be focused on . Yeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , <disfmarker> So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see <disfmarker> Right . Oh well , no , they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , Mm-hmm . whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . Mm-hmm . So , be careful what you put on the buttons So maybe we could have like <disfmarker> and be careful of the shape that you make them , Mm-hmm . Yeah . because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes . Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .
And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . <vocalsound> Maybe a banana or courgette or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ? I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . Okay . Cool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one <disfmarker> that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . <vocalsound> So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 'Kay . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends <vocalsound> are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . <vocalsound> And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic .
Yeah and then you could have <disfmarker> Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , Yeah , that's true . do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ? I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . Yeah . .. . Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . So it is a possibility , um . But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? We haven't really seen that yet <gap> because you could have your company uh <disfmarker> We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge Mm-hmm . I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know . I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> to something which is maybe more universal . Mm-hmm . Well <disfmarker> But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , Mm-hmm . So . Hmm . And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . Ah d d But if <disfmarker> Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . Mm-hmm . Well . Yep . Maybe still with a rubber design we could <disfmarker> Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this <disfmarker> Or was <disfmarker> the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , I suppose . I think <disfmarker> Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case <disfmarker> So don't change case . I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . Yeah . Uh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay <disfmarker> and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Yeah . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions <vocalsound> like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production ,
One one thing to cons Shall I just turn it round for time ? one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um <disfmarker> by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other <gap> That should come up . therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can <disfmarker> if you can store them up on top of each other . Mm <gap> . Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . Yeah . 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 'Kay . Sorry what was that last thing again there ? Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . Right <gap> much option on that . .. . Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple . <vocalsound> Maybe yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . Mm-hmm . 'Kay , so shall we quickly <disfmarker> Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? We'll go for single curve , yeah . But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh <vocalsound> I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . Mm-hmm . Okay . It was , wasn't it ? Yeah . It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . So the <disfmarker> I suppose . I think <disfmarker> Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case <disfmarker> So don't change case . And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to <disfmarker> that we seemed to leave out . Okay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <vocalsound> Or veg . Yeah So it's rubber buttons , I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , Right . Um . whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . Yeah . so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . 'Kay . Yeah . Mm . <gap> it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . Okay . I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . Mayb Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it could be red . <gap> Could be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind . A red apple ? Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , Is it ?
So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out . <gap> I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . <vocalsound>
Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ? Right . Okay . 'Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the <disfmarker> curved or double curved ? So it's single curved . So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . Okay . The one you move around ? and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .
Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .
Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .
Yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah So so what are we deciding to do here ? Um . I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . Right . Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . Yeah . and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board .
And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to <disfmarker> that we seemed to leave out . Okay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <vocalsound> Or veg . Yeah .. . Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple . <vocalsound> Maybe yeah . <vocalsound> Well it could be red . <gap> Could be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind .
It was , wasn't it ? Yeah . It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . So the <disfmarker> 'Kay , so shall we quickly <disfmarker> Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? We'll go for single curve , yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <gap> And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . Rubber <disfmarker> Right . Um . Either , don't mind . Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , Is it ?
You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge Mm-hmm . because you could have your company uh <disfmarker> We're we're meant to be finishing up .
<vocalsound> Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of <vocalsound> our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think <disfmarker> looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs
Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your <disfmarker> to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes <disfmarker> You could change the vegetable , or fruit . yeah , I can change the vegetable . The <disfmarker> it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . <vocalsound> So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . It's been a l And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . <vocalsound> It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .
And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was <disfmarker> or design yet actually , would be the um thing <disfmarker> the locator . How how <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . Okay so that's just <disfmarker> And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere So you have to have a button on your on your <disfmarker> you have to attach the button to the <disfmarker> Yeah we didn't design that . Yeah we have <disfmarker> that that has yes yet to be designed . But it would be coordinating with that of course . Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . Yeah .
So . Tada . Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . it was a real challenge there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed <disfmarker> I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be <disfmarker> My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . But it's really not very clear , <vocalsound> Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? Mm-hmm . Um and lots of special colours actually . <vocalsound> Uh scroll wheel . No I think that's alright . Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . <vocalsound>
I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And <vocalsound> we we have therefore in total um <disfmarker> We have five <disfmarker> we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . Um so the que the questions I've given you <disfmarker> c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . it's <disfmarker> if it's fancy you put one , One , right okay . if it's really unfancy it's seven . If it's somewhere in between you put four . Are we just about ready ? Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we <disfmarker> um is it necessary ? I don't think so . It's <disfmarker> right um <disfmarker> Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle . One . <vocalsound> Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ? Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . No no that's um <disfmarker> So I need <disfmarker> where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um .
Right . One point three is <disfmarker> So it's a one was true and seven was false ? <gap> Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? together to decide whether it meets the standards . And <vocalsound> we we have therefore in total um <disfmarker> We have five <disfmarker> we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Yeah . I really <disfmarker> Oh I thought it was the other way round . Wait a minute . I thought it was the other way round too . Well uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . True's one and false is seven . Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? Um we can do it separately and then discuss it <vocalsound> right um <disfmarker> Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle . One . <vocalsound> Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?
Material <vocalsound> technologically innovative , okay . Um , Think the critical ones came out to be <disfmarker> yeah that one . <vocalsound> . Batteries easy to insert for some reason , <vocalsound> which can be easily <disfmarker> I think that's not a problem any more . The batteries are going in the back ? <vocalsound> Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like <disfmarker> It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . Yeah that's true . I didn't know how else to do it . I think we should look at the ones that <vocalsound> like where s where people said four , where <disfmarker> um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one . Mm-hmm . that was material . Slide show .
although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . I didn't <disfmarker> like <disfmarker> sorta like a joystick . You could do <gap> , What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And like then it <disfmarker> you could hold it in your hand better . I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .
Mm . And you could <disfmarker> like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think we needn't <disfmarker> What if um the <disfmarker> it was just patterns on like <disfmarker> we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . Huh ? Yeah that's true . Mm . I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . Yeah . But if we if we need <disfmarker> Yeah and just have the colour match or something . yeah . I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? 'Cause like kind of <disfmarker> We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . Yeah , yeah .
Mm . It's alright yeah ? Um <disfmarker> Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of <disfmarker> Sure . It's quite <disfmarker> They're kinda hard to write with though . I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um <disfmarker> What do you guys think of the pens ? I wanna s It asks about that . They're pretty cool . oh no that's not um <disfmarker> Do you want this and we can all <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied <disfmarker> oh , oh it's alright .
Yeah we didn't <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> uh it all c sort of blended quite well . <vocalsound> Sponginess . <vocalsound> The prototype making was very creatively stimulating <vocalsound> I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .
<vocalsound> Um and the means for like <disfmarker> the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard , <vocalsound> I mean we used <disfmarker> Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . Are you a Mac person ? <vocalsound> I felt like my <disfmarker> I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my <disfmarker> the information that was available to me was kind of just like <disfmarker> or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda <disfmarker> it was kinda like okay , I don't really think <disfmarker> I dunno what I'm doing here . <vocalsound> So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , Yeah . It <disfmarker> I though it was brilliant no ? <vocalsound> My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . Really ? <vocalsound> Yeah I think so . yeah , yeah . 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like <disfmarker> they'd put <disfmarker> send you to sites and stuff right ? you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , 'cause I <disfmarker> Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um System .
<vocalsound> It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food . So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause <disfmarker> All of us ? I don't know . Hmm . Well there's al eight , nine . Ooh . Oh ooh . Hmm . Or is that just me ? <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food . So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause <disfmarker> So I think that's all for today . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . <vocalsound>
although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . I didn't <disfmarker> like <disfmarker> sorta like a joystick .

'Cause like kind of <disfmarker> We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . Yeah , yeah .
The prototype making was very creatively stimulating <vocalsound> and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria <vocalsound> . And how was our leadership and teamwork ? <vocalsound> which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all <disfmarker> we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . <vocalsound>
although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .

Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . Are you a Mac person ? <vocalsound>
I felt like my <disfmarker> I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my <disfmarker> the information that was available to me was kind of just like <disfmarker> or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda <disfmarker> it was kinda like okay , I don't really think <disfmarker> I dunno what I'm doing here . <vocalsound> So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , Yeah . It <disfmarker> I though it was brilliant no ? <vocalsound> My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . Really ? <vocalsound> Yeah I think so . yeah , yeah . 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like <disfmarker> they'd put <disfmarker> send you to sites and stuff right ? you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , 'cause I <disfmarker> Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um System .
so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control <gap> functions , Uh-huh . so maybe we could think about colour ? Mm-hmm . that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , Okay . we're looking for <disfmarker> What do we think a good size would be for this ? <gap> We're <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . So presumably that might be an idea to put into . But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .
that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , Okay . Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . where they're , yeah . Mm . So presumably that might be an idea to put into . But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .
that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , we're looking for <disfmarker> Okay . so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , What do we think a good size would be for this ? <gap> We're <disfmarker> Then you lose it , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like ,
uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Yeah . Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um <vocalsound> basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how <disfmarker> what sort of materials are available to you whatever . And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . Which will probably just usurp what I said so <disfmarker> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? Shapes and colours and <disfmarker> um basically how to make it attractive . Yep . Okay .
uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Yeah .
Which will probably just usurp what I said so <disfmarker> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? Shapes and colours and <disfmarker> um basically how to make it attractive . Yep . Okay .

Okay . Um well , the function <vocalsound> of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . <vocalsound> And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . <gap> And we can decide if that's what we want , <gap> , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . Okay . Okay . These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , <vocalsound> and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is <disfmarker> fast-forward is also like next on a menu . And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete .
Oh , I'm sorry . <vocalsound> That's okay . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . I I think it's like the engineering versus user , Okay . <vocalsound> Ready for the next slide ? Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . It's okay . Could be , yeah . Uh possibly . Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? Like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . User-friendly . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . <gap> And also we found <disfmarker> our team found that speech recognition is <disfmarker> it's like an up-and-coming thing they really <disfmarker> I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . Yeah . <vocalsound> Didn't they <disfmarker> um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would <disfmarker> the remote would beep so if you have lost it <disfmarker> It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . You know like go to the base . We could definitely include that if we wanted to . Yeah . 'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the <vocalsound> users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want <disfmarker> they've <disfmarker> are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really So that's really what we need to do . <gap> Wait . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So <disfmarker> And that meaning what ?
whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex Oh , right . and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . The buttons .
That's okay . Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . <gap> Um a large on-off button , <vocalsound> 'Kay . 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . Oh my bad . <vocalsound> demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . <vocalsound> We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .
Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , Okay . but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . The l <vocalsound> the light up kind of <disfmarker> Like that we know the battery's working . Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .
Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . <vocalsound> Okay . Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , <vocalsound> and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so <disfmarker> Alright .
You mentioned um older people ? Mm-hmm . Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically <disfmarker> It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah . non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so <disfmarker> They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range <disfmarker> Yeah , I think we need it all .
Well , then we could <disfmarker> If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . Mm . but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So <vocalsound> basically older people don't really care . It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . <gap> whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Yeah . <gap> and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . I need <disfmarker> we we need a like homing device . like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , But you got a base . and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . Do you think people'll really go for that though ? I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . Right . Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Yeah . Hmm . Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . Yeah .
I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? For the menus . No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . Mm-hmm . Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . <gap> Well , we definitely need those . How how , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so <disfmarker> 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . The colour being yellow ? We could just have the logo in yellow , Can't make it entirely <disfmarker> or maybe a yellow light for the keys . Or is the l Well if you have like a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom <gap> the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , Right , yeah . Yeah . or no menu buttons . So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ .
And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 'Kay .
And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept ,
Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .
'Kay . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .
Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . Help me . We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .
Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , Okay . but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . The l <vocalsound> the light up kind of <disfmarker> Like that we know the battery's working . Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red ,
Just <disfmarker> Okay . Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , Mm . I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . Ovals .
You mentioned um older people ? Mm-hmm . Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically <disfmarker> It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah . non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so <disfmarker>
First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . <vocalsound> Okay . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom <gap> the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , Right , yeah . Yeah . or no menu buttons . So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> That one ? So we just have it like <disfmarker> add a menu button then for the various things needed , Right .
'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so <disfmarker> 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . The colour being yellow ?
whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Yeah . I need <disfmarker> we we need a like homing device . like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? <gap> and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .
Two . <vocalsound> Good morning . Hello . Hello . Hello . So you all read what we are going to do or not ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah . We're gonna make a remote control . Yeah , that's right . <vocalsound> etchy . I just made a a simple uh presentation . So you <gap> put some things in it . <vocalsound> Okay . So that's my name , <gap> . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to <disfmarker> uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly <gap> that's what we're going to design .
that's what it <disfmarker> that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for <disfmarker> what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . <vocalsound> Okay so <disfmarker> uh no , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly <gap> that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design ,
Okay so <disfmarker> uh no , this is a <disfmarker> these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw <disfmarker> you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . Folder , have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have <disfmarker> this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ? This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . and a different colour can use here <gap> no blue . And uh line width <vocalsound> ten . Okay uh just take <disfmarker> what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . I dunno what it looks <disfmarker> just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . Okay . <gap> Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do <disfmarker> It's in format . Yeah . Just make a new blank new blank page . Yeah . Okay . Um let's make it um a dog . Ooh . Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Take it easy . 'Kay , I make a cat of it . <vocalsound> I have it . okay . I just draw too quick I think . Okay , It's just to get used to it . Okay . I thought these pens would be just um <disfmarker> uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? Yeah , that's right , it <disfmarker> but you actually got to write on the paper . But it's just <disfmarker> Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , Yeah yeah , Yeah , but it's just a picture . just <disfmarker> So <vocalsound> You really <disfmarker> Y you can you can't edit in the <disfmarker> edit it in Word . it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . No . Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so . <vocalsound>
Okay , that's <gap> . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . Piece of cake . The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry . Uh easy . So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Excuse me .
I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have <gap> a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the <gap> and everything , so just have a look how it <disfmarker> we think about remote controls . Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a <vocalsound> a universal remote control ? Oh yeah , that's a good question . Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . I think it's <disfmarker>
Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros I don't know . Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Yeah , I think . Ah okay . Okay , perfect . And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> okay . so a lot of buttons <vocalsound> on the remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , probably . it's not mm <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , it probably would be universal . Universal . And only television ? Or more devices ? I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so <disfmarker>
<gap> . so yeah , Okay . what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not <disfmarker> nothing very special , but um <disfmarker> Well we can try to make it special . yeah , that's right . <gap> <disfmarker> we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . <vocalsound> Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , And how big should it be ? N No . Yeah . <gap> It shouldn't be too big , I dunno um <disfmarker> but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . Yeah . We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Yeah . Yeah . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , Yes maybe more trendy . But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think <disfmarker> Okay , Yeah , if you just <disfmarker> something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . Ah right right . Yeah . Oh O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . that's good , yeah . b I wanted <disfmarker> Yeah . Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? <vocalsound> Uh maybe be uh it's it's <disfmarker> you can make an uh manual in it . Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . Okay . Yeah , But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . but but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . <gap> And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , Yeah . because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . Yeah , too fragile . No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . <vocalsound> Kid-proof .
Um <disfmarker> Uh should you put it in a recharger or a <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> Oh maybe that's a good idea , Ma maybe a home station . just to put it on your television and just s recharge , Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . Yeah , Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? I dunno . Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , <vocalsound> Ah yeah . but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . <gap> Maybe have <gap> uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably <disfmarker> it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are <disfmarker> uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . Yeah . Rechargeable . Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , Yeah . or you can change your batteries , Oh yeah . so . The option , just the option , that's cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> And uh how about the batteries ?
The option , just the option , that's cool . Yeah . Uh I I set something on paper already , <gap> size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , Yeah . uh it has to lay good in the hand , Yeah . you you have to uh <disfmarker> Has it be <disfmarker> has <disfmarker> does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control Yeah , but it's very hard to <disfmarker> N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . Nah . Well you can um have uh <vocalsound> the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . Yeah . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . Yeah . And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you <vocalsound> can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , Yeah . but uh i <vocalsound> and if you fold it open <disfmarker> basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , But maybe it's That's what I meant . so . maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh <disfmarker> what's it's called ? Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an <disfmarker> uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . <gap> Maybe it's hard t Uh <disfmarker> No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control <gap> . Okay , but yeah . Just think about it . Yeah .
Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the <disfmarker> what you want to do with it . Yeah , I think this <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Okay . Yeah , What do you want to do with your remote control , Okay . Just if <disfmarker> what's in the market , Just think about it . Yeah . We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . Okay . Yeah .
Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the <disfmarker> what you want to do with it . Yeah , I think this <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Okay . Yeah , Okay . Just if <disfmarker> what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . What do you want to do with your remote control , Okay . Yeah .
Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Yeah , I think . Ah okay . Okay , perfect . And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and <disfmarker> it's not mm <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , it probably would be universal . Universal .
just take <disfmarker> what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . Come on . There we are . My laptop is crashing . <vocalsound> Can you hear me ? Hello ? Test . Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , I dunno . Check . Oh no . Okay . I think it works . Test test . just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? <vocalsound> Okay . How does this work ? I dunno . <gap> How do I do <disfmarker> It's in format . This one ? Yes . Press F_ eleven . Ah
Um <disfmarker> Uh should you put it in a recharger or a <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> Oh maybe that's a good idea , Ma maybe a home station . just to put it on your television and just s recharge , Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . Yeah , Maybe have <gap> uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably <disfmarker> it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are <disfmarker> uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , Oh yeah . so . The option , just the option , that's cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> And uh how about the batteries ?
Well we can try to make it special . yeah , that's right . Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Yeah . Yeah . But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think <disfmarker> Okay , Yeah . Oh O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . that's good , yeah . And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , b I wanted <disfmarker> Yeah . Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? <vocalsound> Uh maybe be uh it's it's <disfmarker> when you have it closed , you <vocalsound> can still uh do the th the functions . Okay . Yeah , But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . but That's what I meant . so . maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh <disfmarker> what's it's called ? Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an <disfmarker> uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . <gap> Maybe it's hard t Uh <disfmarker> No , that's right . Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . Yeah , too fragile . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control <gap> . Okay , but yeah . Just think about it . Yeah .
oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting <vocalsound> is um <disfmarker> we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options .
<vocalsound> This is what we came up with . Yeah , here we are . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah .
Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here where's the L_E_D_ ? Oops . It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . Oh . Okay . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be So it's palm-held . accessible from your thumb and all the Yeah . buttons are accessible from your thumb . Notice you have a number ten button .
But I was just wondering But I suppose it's not as snappy . like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . Well the there is a <disfmarker> there's a delay on remotes I think . Oops . Yeah Mm-hmm . um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Oh okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah . And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . So one plus one would be eleven , <vocalsound> You can go one , three or something . Oh . You press that first and then you go one three You press a plus button ? yeah . Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before . Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and <disfmarker> O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . Oh it smells good . <vocalsound> Of Play Doh yeah . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , Oh right . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? Sixty . or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and <disfmarker> It looks more <disfmarker> Think like vanilla and banana would . Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company <disfmarker> the yellow and black . Yeah . Well I don't mind , we can further define that . what do you think is simpler ? It's a <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Okay so question number one . you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . That's me . Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on <disfmarker> right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our <disfmarker> both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come on . Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <vocalsound> Three . but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . Okay , so should we say two for that ? Sure . Uh , question number five . What's um <disfmarker> will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . I think we have to market it in the right way , that um <disfmarker> to say that it is simplistic . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And <vocalsound> the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Oh no the plus . <vocalsound> You're No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , <disfmarker> use the zero . I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . But you don't have to buy batteries . Fifteen ? So in the long term this can actually save you money . Yeah . Yeah . I would give it a two still though . Yeah . Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? <vocalsound> Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . Or <disfmarker> So that was mainly that the statistics <disfmarker> Yeah . I think it does very well . Oh yeah . They're clearly there , easy to use . Yeah . Okay so one ? Yeah . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the <disfmarker> We have the alarm system . is the alarm system still <disfmarker> was it implemented ? Yeah Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . It'll be again in the marketing . I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . Yeah . But both <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . If you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You press the button it makes a noise <vocalsound> It turns into a duck and starts quacking . but you still couldn't see it . but you can't see an alarm inside uh <disfmarker> the alarm system itself . It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . Okay . <vocalsound> Sorry . We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Yeah , totally . No problem , mm . Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . Totally . yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . So the plu the plus <disfmarker> The plus thing needs to be worked on . w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , Um , okay so we can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I'd say w yeah one . we'll say yes it's uh one ? Yeah . Question number nine . Oh . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? <vocalsound> Hmm . S I think so . It's like right in the <disfmarker> yeah . I don't think it will f We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . Yeah , yeah , I think too . two . Yeah Two okay . Yeah . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Yes we did . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . It sounds like the colour's something that we <disfmarker> Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . Yeah . Gray , yeah . So it could be grey on the banana one . Yeah , could be grey . I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . Okay . Ooh . Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? Mm . Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating Yeah . and <disfmarker> The look is a little bit more playful . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? Four I think . I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean <vocalsound> th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . Mm-hmm . Four ? Okay , and final question . <vocalsound> Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? <vocalsound> Following that briefing we did . But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . <vocalsound> Okay <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I kinda <disfmarker> I like the potato look . <vocalsound> Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . I would say two . Personally . I w I'd say two I think . It's a two ? Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was <vocalsound> is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . Yeah . Yeah and the use of the rubber . <vocalsound> Isn't <disfmarker> Mm . and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . Mm-hmm . And I think <disfmarker> I mean it it's tough to say because we were <disfmarker> we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . Yeah . Though it was our specification . Yeah we want it simple . So I mean I <disfmarker> we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . Yeah . <vocalsound> We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ? I think so . Yeah . Yeah I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . One . Yeah . you can't really get confused with that . Yeah . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number <disfmarker> the plus system . Th The plus number thing . Yeah that's the only thing yeah . But once that's figured out , it should be fine . Yeah and perhaps the turning on <vocalsound> Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Mm . Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <vocalsound> It's definitely <disfmarker> Again I think the colour comes into this . Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> . I think that the logo could be smaller . Okay . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . Not in <disfmarker> I suppose I've got quite big hands . I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . Well <disfmarker> But you know what I've just thought of there now . What <disfmarker> where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . and then the rest is like Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand <vocalsound> . round .
<vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? Yes we do . <vocalsound> This is <gap> . Okay . Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh .
Um , we're using plastic and rubber , Yeah . I guess we should do it just for one kind . Yeah . So it's like special colour <disfmarker> well we'll have two colours right ? Yeah . Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Good work guys . So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . That's good . <vocalsound> Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , Oh right . Um we're using a regular chip . Yeah . Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . Double That's another three . We're already at five .
Alright how were our means ? Um <disfmarker> We needed more Play Doh colours . Yeah . <vocalsound> Is that good <disfmarker> Yeah . The computer programmes are good . Yeah . I'm not sure , new ideas found . Hmm ? Yeah well I guess we really <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Pushed for creativity ? I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . The ma Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really When we can down to it . and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . Yeah . Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . Yeah . I think that's a sign of good leadership Mm-hmm . and also our personal coach helped us along the way , <vocalsound> And the timing was good . I think it's been fine . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . And project manager of course . Teamwork ? I think we worked great as a team . Yeah .
Thank you very much . <vocalsound> Okay , bye . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> By watching T_V_ ? <vocalsound> Yay . Fantastic . in such a way that I have no idea . Alright ? Yeah .
O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . Oh it smells good . <vocalsound> Yeah Mm-hmm . um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .
But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , Oh right .
I guess we should do it just for one kind . Yeah . So it's like special colour <disfmarker> well we'll have two colours right ?
Oh right . Um we're using a regular chip . Yeah .
Um we're using a regular chip . Yeah . Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . Double
Um , we're using plastic and rubber , Yeah . That's another three . We're already at five .
<vocalsound> Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening <vocalsound> stuff , <vocalsound> then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be <disfmarker> you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . <vocalsound> So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . <vocalsound> And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <vocalsound> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . Okay it's an abstract drawing . Do you know ? It's a cat . <vocalsound> Okay . So what could I draw ? <vocalsound> Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . <vocalsound> And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <vocalsound> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . <vocalsound> What an original idea . I don't know if it looks like a cow <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry too <vocalsound> uh .
Let's move on . So <disfmarker> Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . I is there a matter for a new remote control ? <vocalsound> Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ?
<vocalsound> Ah yeah . Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . <vocalsound> but uh of course we <disfmarker> you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? Yeah d d uh . So i it's just going to add t to the cost . Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to <vocalsound> have an advantage over our competitors . who is giving <disfmarker> who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Which is you . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So what what <disfmarker> so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . <vocalsound> So what's <disfmarker> what are your ideas about that ? Maybe I can have the <disfmarker> your opinion from the marketing side ? Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? <vocalsound> I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think <disfmarker> No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Few buttons . Okay . <vocalsound> And do you have it also to be <disfmarker> to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend <disfmarker> the trend in domain , what it shouldn't <disfmarker> it should look like , or things like that ? <vocalsound> Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . Mm . Okay . The basic requirement . So . Fit in your hand , yeah . <vocalsound> Only a buck . Waterproof . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Water-proof as well . <vocalsound> And I think we should have a device <disfmarker> Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh <disfmarker> in your bath whereas the others can't . Maybe water-proof would be very original . <vocalsound> Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very <disfmarker> And , and that's one of the <disfmarker> that's one of the shock <disfmarker> I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . Yeah , mayb B That's people <gap> they actually do it themselves . But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . That might be good uh track to follow . Optional or selled with it ? <vocalsound> And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Ah yeah . Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . <vocalsound> but uh of course we <disfmarker> you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? Yeah d d uh . So i it's just going to add t to the cost . Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to <vocalsound> have an advantage over our competitors . who is giving <disfmarker> who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Which is you . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So what what <disfmarker> so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . <vocalsound> Maybe I can have the <disfmarker> your opinion from the marketing side ? Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . Yeah . Waterproof . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Water-proof as well . <vocalsound> And I think we should have a device <disfmarker> Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh <disfmarker> in your bath whereas the others can't . Maybe water-proof would be very original . <vocalsound> Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very <disfmarker> And , and that's one of the <disfmarker> that's one of the shock <disfmarker> I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . Yeah , mayb B That's people <gap> they actually do it themselves . But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . That might be good uh track to follow . Optional or selled with it ? <vocalsound> And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . Yeah .
so uh . <vocalsound> Don't pani . <vocalsound> Don't panic . <vocalsound> So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working <disfmarker> any working function we have discussed . Mm-hmm . So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . Mm-hmm . And also um <vocalsound> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <vocalsound> Mm .
<vocalsound> Which is you . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> so uh . <vocalsound> Don't pani . <vocalsound> Don't panic . <vocalsound> So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working <disfmarker> any working function we have discussed . Mm-hmm .
So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working <disfmarker> any working function we have discussed . Mm-hmm . So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . Mm-hmm .
So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . Mm-hmm . And also um <vocalsound> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So .
That's people <gap> they actually do it themselves . But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . That might be good uh track to follow . Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Which is you . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . <vocalsound> who is giving <disfmarker> who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . Yeah . Yeah .
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So the customer basically is confused . They don't know exactly what they want . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , Yeah . 'Kay . Okay , so trend watching . Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they <disfmarker> like of the product that they want , describing like the <disfmarker> in order of how much they want ,
Mm 'kay . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . <vocalsound> Right . Yes . Yeah . Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend ,
Okay , um <vocalsound> <gap> looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide . Sure . Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really <gap> and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both <gap> kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like <vocalsound> using that idea in a remote control but <disfmarker> Anyway , next . Mm 'kay . Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . Okay . Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children . That's cute . and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain <disfmarker> because it's more for like a D_V_D_ <vocalsound> function which we are not gonna be using . Um . So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . Mm .
Yeah . <vocalsound> Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you <gap> functions what <disfmarker> for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . Right . No , I didn't . No , okay . Um the manufacturing division also has said that um <vocalsound> they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . Yeah . Th that looks like it . 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . <vocalsound> Next slide , please . Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . Suggested casing options . Okay . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . No , splinters would <disfmarker>
Now we have to make some decisions . Where were we ? Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , Sure . and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . Um . except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for <disfmarker> So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , <vocalsound> but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme <disfmarker> do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really <disfmarker> Hmm .
Mm 'kay . Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? Okay . Um . I ki I kind of <vocalsound> like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that <disfmarker> the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , Mm . Oh , that's true . because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? Good point . which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , Oh , I see what you mean . 'cause oth <vocalsound> otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . That's squishy . That's squishy . Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . <gap> have buttons . <vocalsound> We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . Yeah . And that's at the bottom of it . I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , For our base one ? <vocalsound> Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . Yeah , What are your thoughts ? or like a gun-metal grey , Gun-metal gray . There you go , gun-metal gray . <vocalsound> I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . Why ? It'll wear off . <vocalsound> What's the button <disfmarker> I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really <disfmarker> Hmm . Programme . I mean we could do it , but <disfmarker> If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology <disfmarker> Technology . So , I mean <disfmarker> But , I guess , we have to look at w what <vocalsound> our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um . Okay . and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want Yes . I'd , well uh <disfmarker> 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . This one is really comfortable , So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . Yeah . Ouch . A phone , whoa , that would <disfmarker> wow , that would hurt . Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? Pieces everywhere . Well , we have lots of options . I don't think wood is a viable option . Yeah wood . right ? Yeah . 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , That'll <disfmarker> Yeah . Well the original <disfmarker> I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm Twenty five Euros Okay . not sure that we'll have the time and money to <vocalsound> produce a whole array of <gap> Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? How complicated <disfmarker> Are we gonna go with the voice activated <disfmarker> Yeah .
Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ? I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be <disfmarker> have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . Right . Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact <disfmarker>
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . Right . I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . A tracker , yeah . for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , Hmm .
if they wanted . I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could <vocalsound> give two latex covers to start . Yeah . Honestly I'd recommend like um <disfmarker> Hmm . uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , <gap> because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , God only knows why , Yeah , who knows . um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know <disfmarker>
Mm . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Yellow . The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so <gap> it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , Hmm . so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Like a little cut-out kind of <disfmarker> Yeah .
Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put <disfmarker> We'll all talk about it , I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . Great . Play Doh .
Yeah . <vocalsound> I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .

not sure that we'll have the time and money to <vocalsound> produce a whole array of <gap> Twenty five Euros Okay .
Right . Okay , so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements . Um . So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh <disfmarker> for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . Um . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um <disfmarker> W I I got um <gap> or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Um did you get any information on that ? Uh we didn't , no . No . Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . I d I didn't personally . Hmm . So I I got that in email form . <vocalsound>
Um . So that's <gap> . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . So this is the uh user interface . Um this is the chip itself , which then <gap> , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . And the sender sends a message to the receiver . Ah yes , that's the power source . Um . <gap> going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . <vocalsound> Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . Okay , um <disfmarker> Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um <vocalsound> of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Okay . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . <gap> . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . I'll just go through there . Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get <disfmarker> it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be <disfmarker> <gap> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends <gap> after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends <disfmarker> It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <vocalsound>
Um . So that's <gap> . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get <disfmarker> it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be <disfmarker> <gap> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends <gap> after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends <disfmarker> It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <vocalsound>
Ah yes , that's the power source . Um . <gap> going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . <vocalsound> Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well .
Oh . ei Oh , th there you go . Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . <vocalsound> Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , <vocalsound> it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Well there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . <vocalsound> I haven't as yet , no . Will you be presenting that in a bit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . So uh I'm guessing that uh uh
Mm-hmm . <gap> Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting <disfmarker> rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty <gap> Hmm . and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want Mm-hmm . Mm . Um . Anyway . But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly . But I suppose nine's not really excessive . I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you <disfmarker> uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , Yeah . So we get to <disfmarker> How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . Mm-hmm . Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market <vocalsound> was one of the considerations . 'Kay . Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . What do you mean by the circular section ? so maybe we could get rid of that as well . Yeah . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . Well b uh w I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . Well th the on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Like how often do you hit nine ? Mm-hmm . Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . It's just people are used to seeing that , But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean <vocalsound> how many channels do we have to um <disfmarker> actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? and at the moment we've got <disfmarker> although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six <vocalsound> and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . Mm-hmm . 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .
<gap> Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age <disfmarker> forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <vocalsound> Okay , so <disfmarker> My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some <vocalsound> sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <disfmarker> A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .
But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . Youn young people pref and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um . Yeah . Yeah . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to <vocalsound> speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . Mm . Do <gap> a lot of um <disfmarker> What was that last wee bit there ? Um about speech recognition ? Speech recognition , <vocalsound> Yeah .
Well that's right . Yeah . And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have <disfmarker> You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can <disfmarker> <gap> some kind of buzzer system between the two . Yeah . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but <disfmarker> That is true , yes . Hmm . There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , Yeah . and then they whistle back , or something like that . Sounds reasonable . Yeah . That'd probably be really simple , they're cheap . Yeah . So <disfmarker> So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the <disfmarker> or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you <disfmarker> I know . Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . <vocalsound> You'd want to try and av just have the one product Yeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . <vocalsound> Yeah . But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then <disfmarker> <gap> you could have an option to turn it off . Or <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Perhaps , um . Yeah . So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . Mm . Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? <vocalsound> Mm . Considering <disfmarker> Well if it does then we can't . Yeah .
So <disfmarker> and if <disfmarker> and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . Mm-hmm . So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . Yes . So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick Has to be simple enough to <disfmarker> because time to market is is critical . S <vocalsound> It would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . 'Kay .
So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S I would guess so . Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . Mm-hmm . I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . Yeah . I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . I <vocalsound> w well uh i 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , <gap> I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , No , clapping , I think clapping , I'd go more <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? Uh . <vocalsound> Taking out teletext , okay . so so take out teletext . Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers Right . and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine . Mm . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , Yeah . and then some kind of device to allow uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . Yeah . As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ? Uh <vocalsound> we could possibly put an L_ <disfmarker> a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that <disfmarker> But just thinking um people probably <disfmarker> I mean you don't have <disfmarker> you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . Yeah . So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that . And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . Yeah . 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , That's right . so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . <gap> Yeah . Yeah . So how would this menu function work ? Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . <vocalsound> like the volume or something . Okay . Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week Right . Okay . Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? Okay , well . Yeah . So y So you don't use it that much , Ah That's a very good idea . you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it . That is that is a good idea actually . Yeah , yeah . Uh not quite , but I guess <gap> . Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . Keep the other buttons but hide them away . Hmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , So <disfmarker> Yeah . So um <vocalsound> we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . So th the <disfmarker> Can bring out when needed . The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , Yeah . I guess so . So on the <disfmarker> So on front , <gap> about the number <gap> . numbers , Um the volume up and down . And the volume ? Um . A mute button as well . Yeah . I think they're handy . Mm-hmm . And probably a power one as well . <vocalsound> Dunno . Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . <vocalsound> Compromise . Well <vocalsound> <gap> . Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . Okay , so we'll have um <disfmarker> Right . So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? Um . What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ? Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th Yeah si Right okay . On mute . And a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ? You've got brightness and contrast . Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . And then <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . anything else ? Uh there's audio functions . You're also gonna have the channel tuner <gap> , as it were . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . Yeah . Okay . Do they have their own <disfmarker> do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , Um maybe for the younger market . or do you have to do it via the remote ? Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . Yeah I suppose if we've got their <disfmarker> if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . Yeah . Yeah . Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions About five minutes . and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . Yes .
'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , <gap> I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , No , clapping , I think clapping , I'd go more <disfmarker> Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers Right . and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine . Mm . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , Yeah . and then some kind of device to allow uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . Yeah .
Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ? You've got brightness and contrast . Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . And then <disfmarker> Right . Okay . Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? Okay , well . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So y So you don't use it that much , Ah That's a very good idea . you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it . That is that is a good idea actually . Yeah , yeah . anything else ? Uh there's audio functions . You're also gonna have the channel tuner <gap> , as it were . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Uh not quite , but I guess <gap> . Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . Keep the other buttons but hide them away . Hmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So um <vocalsound> we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . So th the <disfmarker> Can bring out when needed . The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , Yeah .
Well shall we look into that and just get back together . Okay . Well you might get some research . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , <gap> I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , No , clapping , I think clapping , I'd go more <disfmarker>
Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers Right . and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . Yeah , I think so , and then some kind of device to allow uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . Yeah .
Uh not quite , but I guess <gap> . Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . Keep the other buttons but hide them away .
We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . <vocalsound> Compromise . Well <vocalsound> <gap> . Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . Okay , so we'll have um <disfmarker> What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ? Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th Yeah si Right okay . On mute . And a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ? You've got brightness and contrast . Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . Mm-hmm . anything else ? Uh there's audio functions . You're also gonna have the channel tuner <gap> , as it were . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . So th the <disfmarker> Can bring out when needed . The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , Yeah . I guess so . So on the <disfmarker> So on front , <gap> about the number <gap> . numbers , Um the volume up and down . And the volume ? Um . A mute button as well . Yeah . I think they're handy . Mm-hmm . And probably a power one as well . <vocalsound> Dunno . Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?
So <disfmarker> and if <disfmarker> and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . Mm-hmm . So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . Yes . So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick Has to be simple enough to <disfmarker> because time to market is is critical . S <vocalsound> It would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . 'Kay .
Okay . Um , Nice . basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so <disfmarker> Mm . Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look <disfmarker> if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um <disfmarker> the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . Hmm . Mm . So we'll have to look into that . Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah . Okay , brilliant . Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . Hmm . Right . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Nice . Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record <disfmarker> if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part <disfmarker> use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . Hmm . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Interesting . Mm . Good call . is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like <disfmarker> Choose it . Yeah . I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course <disfmarker> Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . Yeah . Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . <vocalsound> Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? Interesting question . Yes . I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? Mm . Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is <disfmarker> I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about <disfmarker> I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style
<vocalsound> Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now <disfmarker> basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting <disfmarker> they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um <disfmarker> that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Mm . v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of <disfmarker> and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , <vocalsound> uh not something I I've come up with a <gap> <vocalsound> I like it , I like it . <vocalsound> though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something <disfmarker> Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use <disfmarker> we can use a rubber as part of the case , Mm-hmm . it has a consistency of those stress balls . Yes . overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new <disfmarker> I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Mm . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . Yeah .
<vocalsound> We could . I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , <vocalsound> Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Mm . v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , uh not something I I've come up with a <gap> <vocalsound> I like it , I like it . <vocalsound> though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something <disfmarker> Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use <disfmarker> we can use a rubber as part of the case , Mm-hmm . it has a consistency of those stress balls . Yes . overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new <disfmarker> I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Mm . but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . Yeah . I like the idea of of rubber too because it's <disfmarker> tends to be associated with being durable ,
So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls <vocalsound> that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Yeah Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um <disfmarker> with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um . <vocalsound> right . Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Mm . which I am sure most of you know about . Mm . Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern <gap> a bit bulky , a bit crazy , Mm . Mm . I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . No . And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your <disfmarker> for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I <disfmarker> again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , Um , again probably not what we're going for <vocalsound> so I <disfmarker> I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Okay . although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh <disfmarker> our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already Mm . and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . Mm . And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank
thanks guys , um . <vocalsound> Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um <vocalsound> various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?
if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just <disfmarker> it just becomes cost prohibitive . which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , 'Kay . What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? <vocalsound> Well my p <vocalsound> is <disfmarker> Nathan ? Mm . Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would <disfmarker> they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition Mm . we're not gonna have to do as much design work <vocalsound> Right . I'm getting <disfmarker> alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . Sorted . <vocalsound> We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . It's you and me outside a little here . <vocalsound> um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um <vocalsound> various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new 'Kay . 'Kay . But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then Mm-hmm . right ? My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , <vocalsound> Per ? yeah that's just an estimate though . Piece . There is , it's just , it is a question of <disfmarker> and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Can we justify it ? Right . So <disfmarker> Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? That's just off the top of my head , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Though I think that's what people would pay for , <vocalsound> I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something <disfmarker> That's true , so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Yeah . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . Mm . if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we <disfmarker> yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> our main selling point here . Mm . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , Yeah 'cause with voice recognition <disfmarker> I think that our casing and the voice recognition <disfmarker> I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . <vocalsound> The voice rec thing , Yeah . I mean , <vocalsound> if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , <vocalsound> I think we might have to drop the voice rec . I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Yeah . To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , Price-wise . I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice <disfmarker> True . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? I think if we <disfmarker> we do both the <disfmarker> obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into <disfmarker> it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Pretty much . It would be very nice . I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Does having both really up our costs ? <vocalsound> I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism ,
We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . Okay . You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . Mm . Mm . Yep . like what if <disfmarker> wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably <disfmarker> It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , <vocalsound> Calculator . and you know how those those don't really require that much light , Yeah . True . Okay . What do you think Ron ? I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . Okay .
if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Hmm . Do you think people that are <disfmarker> people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . right . Yep . Yeah . I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . With the bu yeah . And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I think , I think you're on to something Mm-hmm . because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , Mm-hmm . you know like that little pod looking thing ? Mm . Yeah , I mean a nice <disfmarker> although we do um wh uh is <disfmarker> I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing Right . Mm . and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um <disfmarker> That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . Uh <disfmarker> Interesting . <vocalsound> Yeah . Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? Just a thought . What's the uh idea ? Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . I
um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit <disfmarker> gives just a bit . Yeah . You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . Right . Just kind of the squishy feel . Yeah , <vocalsound> Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it <disfmarker> literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . Okay . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh <disfmarker> using like a rubber kind of softer feel , Mm .
B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it <disfmarker> say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Yeah . Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um <disfmarker> like on a D_V_D_ player . You know So are we gonna <disfmarker> are we talking <disfmarker> we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um <disfmarker> Well it seems like <vocalsound> I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um <disfmarker> stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um <vocalsound> rubber for the outside case Yeah . Probably . Right . I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . okay so let's work on <vocalsound> uh multiple case colours . But yeah , <vocalsound> Yeah . So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? Or are we just going to go with one ? <vocalsound> Um . ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases Yeah . and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well <disfmarker> mm . Right . It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so <disfmarker> Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . There's an idea . Mm . Yeah . That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the <gap> thing . And again copying iMac's kind of <disfmarker> for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be <disfmarker> Right . Like maybe have menu things . Take precedence , If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out yeah . Yeah , I think that's probably a good id Right . Mm . and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . And they slide .
<vocalsound> Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> using um <vocalsound> prototype building materials um <vocalsound> .
we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh <disfmarker> I'd like <disfmarker> Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <vocalsound> Right .
Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <vocalsound> Right . And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place .
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> using um <vocalsound> prototype building materials um <vocalsound> .
Sorted . <vocalsound> We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . It's you and me outside a little here . <vocalsound>
let's work on <vocalsound> uh multiple case colours . But yeah , Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so
if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Hmm . let's work on <vocalsound> uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda <disfmarker> yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . I
something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . Right . Just kind of the squishy feel . Yeah , Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . Okay . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh <disfmarker> using like a rubber kind of softer feel , Mm .
Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . Mm .
'Kay . 'Kay . But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then Mm-hmm . right ? My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , <vocalsound> Per ? yeah that's just an estimate though . Piece . if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just <disfmarker> it just becomes cost prohibitive . which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction There is , it's just , it is a question of <disfmarker> and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Can we justify it ? Nathan ? Mm . Right . So <disfmarker> Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? That's just off the top of my head , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would <disfmarker> but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Yeah . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? Right . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The voice rec thing , Yeah . I mean , <vocalsound> if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , <vocalsound> I think we might have to drop the voice rec . I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Yeah . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? I think if we <disfmarker> we do both the <disfmarker> obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into <disfmarker> it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Does having both really up our costs ? <vocalsound> I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism ,
Right . So <disfmarker> Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? That's just off the top of my head , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but I think the voice recognition would <disfmarker> Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , <vocalsound> um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers Okay . Nathan ? Mm . Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind ,
Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the <disfmarker> and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . Um , a remote control consist of uh components and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of <disfmarker> in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh <disfmarker> yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . <vocalsound> Mm <disfmarker> It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled <disfmarker> a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to <disfmarker> uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh <disfmarker> Um the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um <disfmarker> Uh here you have to have a hand uh <disfmarker> yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and <disfmarker> so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . That's true , I guess . Yeah . <gap> . Well , maybe a little bit expensive . <vocalsound> Um the chip <disfmarker> uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . Mm , Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . Yeah , production cost . <vocalsound> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it <disfmarker> these were were the most trendiest one . <vocalsound> You know the the cartoonish <vocalsound> Alessi kind of design . Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh <disfmarker> And we can we can steal their ideas .
Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . That's true , I guess . Yeah . <gap> . Well , maybe a little bit expensive . <vocalsound> It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled <disfmarker> a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to <disfmarker> uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh <disfmarker> Um Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .
the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um <disfmarker> Uh here you have to have a hand uh <disfmarker> yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and <disfmarker> so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros .
Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um <vocalsound> um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . <vocalsound> I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh <disfmarker> Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . Didn't we ? Oh , okay . I ha I ha I have the I have <disfmarker> Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just <disfmarker> nothing . no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . Okay . W just <disfmarker> these are the ones you already summed up in the <disfmarker> Yeah , I I uh <vocalsound> well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for <disfmarker> I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . Yeah . I don't know what kind of information it would <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But <disfmarker> Mm yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . No . No . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the <disfmarker> no V_C_R_ or that kind of <disfmarker> No . uh , so that's very easy . Um <disfmarker> But you do mention the next and previous uh button . Mm-hmm . <gap> Next channel , previous channel . Well , that's next channel . I mean <gap> next channel . Oh , okay , o okay okay . So , it's uh just an idea . And I um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left .
I thought so , but maybe with the <disfmarker> Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have <disfmarker> yeah , they have to be large . Yeah , that groups . So , it's uh just an idea . And I um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small <disfmarker> <vocalsound> because that's the mo it <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t Yes . Yeah , I've nothing to <vocalsound> s <vocalsound> Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . Oh , that's right .
Couple time . Oh , great . Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . <vocalsound> Some uh some findings <disfmarker> the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if <disfmarker> of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . <vocalsound> So we probably won't do that . The younger market likes uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , <gap> the <gap> themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . <vocalsound> some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . <vocalsound> And uh , the docking st <vocalsound> uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to <disfmarker> Yeah , the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . uh uh v how do you say ? For diversity or something . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <vocalsound> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . Well , how uh <disfmarker>
Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . <vocalsound> Some uh some findings <disfmarker> the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if <disfmarker> of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people .
So we probably won't do that . The younger market likes uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , <gap> the <gap> themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . <vocalsound> some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . <vocalsound> And uh , the docking st <vocalsound> uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to <disfmarker> Yeah , the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . uh uh v how do you say ? For diversity or something . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <vocalsound> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . Well , how uh <disfmarker>
Only five minutes left , by the way . Yes . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th what what I was saying , the catchy colours <disfmarker> And uh , but I do like the <disfmarker> yeah , I do like uh the f uh to <disfmarker> the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do <disfmarker> I think a dark colour would be nice too . Yeah . But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables <disfmarker> Maybe it's too much , you know . But , we we have to um <disfmarker> There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but <disfmarker> How the buttons <disfmarker> yeah . I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <vocalsound> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . Yes . Well , yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . Yeah , sure . But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . Uh , yeah . Not more than two colours I think . No . No , definitely not . It's a g a little bit too flashy . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . Uh , yeah . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <vocalsound> sake with <vocalsound> remote control ? <vocalsound> No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . Yeah , there's there's always a Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? Just use <disfmarker> I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . So you you can put some fruity things <disfmarker> Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> And we will make it spongy and <disfmarker> and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did <disfmarker> I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w <vocalsound> Yeah , but we're gonna have to <disfmarker> we really have to think <disfmarker> I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but <disfmarker> and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , Yeah . we have a very big uh the s Well , w we can uh <disfmarker> w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . For a big team of artists . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's pear , I guess . <vocalsound> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <vocalsound> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . But uh but I think we don't have to make
I think it's a little too much , yeah . It's overdone . Okay , we s skip the <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display . Okay . When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from <disfmarker> I don't think so . but I don't think it's there <disfmarker> uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . Only if we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Me neither . Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . I mean <disfmarker> Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if <disfmarker> well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think <disfmarker> Uh , I think it will be too expensive . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because <disfmarker> Yes , it can <disfmarker> No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ? Yeah , but <disfmarker> no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . Yeah , I don't know . And it's also not <disfmarker> I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , Well well what would you display on it then ? it's <disfmarker> Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide Programme information . Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . Yeah . I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <vocalsound> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , <vocalsound> Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . Yeah . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable ,
Okay . Well , you will read the minutes uh in the <disfmarker> you can find them in the <disfmarker> In the shared folder . Oh , okay , yeah . pro probably . Yeah <disfmarker> uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . What are we going to do now ? Uh , y yeah . You'll see in you email , I guess . Yeah . Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . Yep .
Okay . Well , you will read the minutes uh in the <disfmarker> you can find them in the <disfmarker> In the shared folder . Oh , okay , yeah . pro probably . Yeah <disfmarker> uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . What are we going to do now ? Okay . So <disfmarker> But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <vocalsound> ordinary keyboard . <vocalsound>
Yeah <disfmarker> uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . What are we going to do now ? Uh , y yeah . You'll see in you email , I guess . Yeah .
I think it's a little too much , yeah . It's overdone . Okay , we s skip the <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display . Okay .
I don't think you <disfmarker> we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , Different fronts . but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . Yeah . I guess that's that's enough .
And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yes . But wha th our basic idea <disfmarker> y I mean , you gonna <disfmarker> we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .
And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Okay . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem Mm , yeah . A mute and a teletext and a menu . uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it .
Okay . Hmm . Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . Mm-hmm . Okay . So <disfmarker> But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <vocalsound> ordinary keyboard . <vocalsound>
what what I was saying , the catchy colours <disfmarker> And uh , but I do like the <disfmarker> yeah , I do like uh the f uh to <disfmarker> the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do <disfmarker> I think a dark colour would be nice too . Yeah . But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables <disfmarker> Maybe it's too much , you know . But , we we have to um <disfmarker> There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <vocalsound> sake with <vocalsound> remote control ? <vocalsound> No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . Yeah , there's there's always a So you you can put some fruity things <disfmarker> Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . <vocalsound> And we will make it spongy and <disfmarker> and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did <disfmarker> I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . we have a very big uh the s Well , w we can uh <disfmarker> w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . For a big team of artists . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's pear , I guess . <vocalsound> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <vocalsound> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . But uh but I think we don't have to make
When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from <disfmarker> I don't think so . but I don't think it's there <disfmarker> uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . Only if we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Me neither . Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . I mean <disfmarker> Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if <disfmarker> well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think <disfmarker> Uh , I think it will be too expensive . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because <disfmarker> Yes , it can <disfmarker> No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ? Yeah , but <disfmarker> no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . Yeah , I don't know . And it's also not <disfmarker> I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , Well well what would you display on it then ? it's <disfmarker> Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide Programme information . Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . Yeah . I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <vocalsound> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , <vocalsound> Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . Yeah . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable ,
It's just like that , th this titanium . Yes , b bu but when we use s soft But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? mm <disfmarker> No , not all , not all of them . But it it <disfmarker> then it uh <disfmarker> you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff <vocalsound> Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? Yeah , I think it I think it does . Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the <disfmarker> In trendy things . Yeah , o Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is <disfmarker> On the other hand , if you want to make fruit <disfmarker> fruity stuff with uh <disfmarker> Yeah .
Only five minutes left , by the way . Yes . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th How the buttons <disfmarker> yeah . I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <vocalsound> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . Yes . Well , yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> Not more than two colours I think . No . No , definitely not . It's a g a little bit too flashy . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . And we will make it spongy and <disfmarker> and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did <disfmarker> I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w <vocalsound> Yeah , but we're gonna have to <disfmarker> we really have to think <disfmarker> I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but <disfmarker> and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know ,
<vocalsound> Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um <vocalsound> who was responsible for what . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um <vocalsound> Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting .
Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , <vocalsound> by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was <disfmarker> I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? Is is it j just just Okay . <vocalsound> Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take <disfmarker> thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> A repetitive strain injury . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at <disfmarker> the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think <disfmarker> and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it . 'Kay . Very nice . Okay . Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? Is is it j just just Okay . <vocalsound> Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .

And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> A repetitive strain injury .
And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at <disfmarker> the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think <disfmarker> and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so
Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um <disfmarker> Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings <gap> market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it . Yeah . 'Kay . Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . <vocalsound> <gap> Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um <vocalsound> the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . <vocalsound> And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to <disfmarker> i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um <disfmarker> Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is <gap> engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um <disfmarker> <gap> which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the <gap> have said and the market research and stuff <gap> probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away <disfmarker> if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under <disfmarker> some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across .
Good . Good . Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . <vocalsound> so um <vocalsound> I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just <disfmarker> This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . <vocalsound> Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically . <vocalsound> So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ? <vocalsound> Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself <vocalsound> . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And <disfmarker> Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . <vocalsound> The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that <disfmarker> that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ? <vocalsound> Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact <vocalsound> available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to we could <disfmarker> the the to the industrial design department . the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive <disfmarker> Expensive it's gonna be get uh . But people have said that they would <disfmarker> well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . Mm-hmm . So Right . possibly it might be worth the investment . I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o <gap> if it's on your phone . Yeah . <vocalsound> I agree . And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <vocalsound> different dialects I suppose as well . Well <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , Yeah . and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . I think <disfmarker> But practically I don't think it's <gap> <disfmarker> It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and <disfmarker>
So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . And we could probably get away with black too but <disfmarker> So those are the three um the three new requirements <gap> go . <vocalsound> Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided <disfmarker> y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . Mm . So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um <disfmarker>
but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . Mm . Um <disfmarker> Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? Um <disfmarker> you think that would help us find um a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ? D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . Mm . I <gap> find anything more on that . Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . <vocalsound> 'Kay . So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . Yeah . Um yellow and <vocalsound> you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . Mm . And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom <vocalsound> all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more <disfmarker> of course this will look like a bone then . <vocalsound> You <disfmarker> I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Yeah . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . Mm . we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um <disfmarker> Hm . Um you know with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . Uh you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down . Power . Power . Usually at the top . Um a mute . That's the classical design . That's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um <disfmarker> A menu button , maybe . Right . So you know . If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um <disfmarker> or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . 'Kay Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So . Like a wheel on your mouse . Yeah , sort of like that . Sort of . You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Right . <vocalsound> 'S a good idea . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just Looks good . Right . Uh <disfmarker> Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the <disfmarker> or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Yes <vocalsound> yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . Yeah . Definitely . <gap> just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know Right on the <disfmarker> and your thumb would be up here type thing . causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So . Yeah that's also true . <gap> instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . Right . Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <vocalsound> Special order . Maybe . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . Yeah . I like the scroll , the scroll action and the <disfmarker> <gap> . I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of <disfmarker> that sort of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing <vocalsound> Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small . Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . Yeah . But then would be easier to lose one or the other . That's right . Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around . So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um <disfmarker> And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . the young the younger people say that they like it . But um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um <disfmarker> And that way we can focus on our form . I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that <disfmarker> if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep <vocalsound> to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . Yeah it would be quite good . The ball could sit on a <disfmarker> Or or with <disfmarker> you know I guess with any form that that would be good . Mm . You know that could be the charger . For Yeah . you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be <disfmarker> Or you know <disfmarker> However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . With the locator button . Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . Um <disfmarker> I'll do the minutes . Uh let's see . It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Minimal number of buttons . I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . Mm .
Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . Right . to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um <disfmarker> Yep .
Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand <disfmarker> let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um <disfmarker> Alright .
<vocalsound> And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts . How well it'll work
we need to finish up here . Um <disfmarker> So for the next <disfmarker> So for the next um <disfmarker> before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on <disfmarker> you're watching trends Mm-hmm .
which is good Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television ,
So we don't have to worry about that . Mm . So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um <disfmarker>
So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics .
Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um <disfmarker> you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . Yeah .
Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . that that I was told we need to use .
We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um <disfmarker> And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take .
I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Minimal number of buttons .
Um yellow and <vocalsound> you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . Mm .
with the buttons being grey or black . Mm . And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom <vocalsound>
Um you know with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . Uh you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down . Power . Power .

Yeah , sort of like that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .
kind of fit in your hand <disfmarker> let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um <disfmarker> Alright .

I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of <disfmarker> that sort of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing
Right . possibly it might be worth the investment . I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o <gap> if it's on your phone . Yeah . <vocalsound> And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <vocalsound> different dialects I suppose as well . Well <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition .

Yeah that's also true . <gap> instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . Right .
Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ? Ebenezer . And your role is ? I'm the Marketing Expert . You're the Marketing Expert , okay . Next we have ? Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ? Industrial Designer . Industrial Designer . And , lastly we have ? Uh , Dave Cochrane . And you're going to be the User Interface , User Interface Defin Designer , yes .
<vocalsound> Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh <disfmarker> but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , Designer . Okay . Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um <disfmarker> First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , <vocalsound> What can I say ? <vocalsound> Ebenezer , you wanna have a <disfmarker> you wanna draw your favourite animal <vocalsound> ? Sure . <vocalsound> it's not the best picture in the world . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Here we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Thank you . Thank you . <vocalsound> Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh <disfmarker> I've always loved tigers .
so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made ,
So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you <vocalsound> and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Okay . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our <disfmarker> Absolutely prohibitive , yeah . yeah . Oh . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g <vocalsound> I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some <gap> and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <vocalsound> um running macros . Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of <disfmarker> For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Any takes on this ? Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , Mm-hmm . but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and <vocalsound> the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . So perhaps one that was more um They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , Yeah I've heard <disfmarker> I've seen the bar-code design before , Mm . it's it's taken out the <disfmarker> Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so <vocalsound> we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? Oh . Okay , <gap> . Like uh control pads , you know of games , but <disfmarker> so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um Yeah . and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <vocalsound> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for <gap> the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <vocalsound> . Okay . So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . A curve , mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <vocalsound> uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .
that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so <vocalsound> we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work ,
so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware ,
Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .
mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <vocalsound> uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <vocalsound> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for <gap> the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <vocalsound> . A curve ,
yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our <disfmarker> Absolutely prohibitive , yeah . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models ,
But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g <vocalsound> I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some <gap> and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <vocalsound> um running macros . Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of <disfmarker> For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um <disfmarker>
Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? Oh . Okay , <gap> . Like uh control pads , you know of games , but <disfmarker> so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um Yeah . and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic ,
Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um <vocalsound> the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And <vocalsound> We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um <vocalsound> that we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That <disfmarker> um <vocalsound> we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . So again um , I'll <disfmarker> we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um <vocalsound> now the the the internal chip um <disfmarker> and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice <vocalsound> and given that <vocalsound> th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean <vocalsound> we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um <vocalsound> go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at <disfmarker> uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . <vocalsound> Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip <disfmarker> the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh <disfmarker> which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ cool . <vocalsound> Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use ,
and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at <disfmarker> uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . <vocalsound> Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip <disfmarker> the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh <disfmarker> which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . <vocalsound> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be <disfmarker> allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , <vocalsound> Okay , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . <vocalsound> And that pretty much sums it up . okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Mm . <vocalsound> Um Do we do we know uh by how much ? I don't actually have any price information , no . <vocalsound> And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . Um it <disfmarker> a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , it's hard to predict the time . <vocalsound> Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , Mm . that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , and that w just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world <disfmarker> the the sky is your limit , Okay . Cause uh I <vocalsound> must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean if you you <disfmarker> speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , Yes , as well . I mean if <disfmarker> given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um <disfmarker> maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . <vocalsound> I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . Yeah , Mm , mm . Yeah , yeah . Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . Mm , right , okay . Fine . Okay . I it will have voice recognition um uh Mm . Cool .
Okay . Okay , Yeah . so I did some research on the internet and um <vocalsound> what <vocalsound> <disfmarker> you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . Mm-hmm . There're some special ones available , like this one right here , Mm , yeah . which is marketed towards children , um different designs , Uh-huh . Alright . and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some <vocalsound> Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like <vocalsound> . <vocalsound>
Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , Yeah , Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a <disfmarker> uh volume and channel change Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , of one sort . yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the <disfmarker> that for rolling , It <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So just kind of minimise the clutter , Mm-hmm . avoid too many buttons and also um <vocalsound> one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , Mm . do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? Mm . I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of <disfmarker> the the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , fair enough , fine . Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down Mm . so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down Yeah . Yeah . this is my great little drawing . So three three <disfmarker> there's three buttons on a slider . <vocalsound> So you kinda take it up one at a time . Okay . The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . D yeah . Okay . Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , Yeah . Yeah . so it'd be kinda good to have them be <disfmarker> feel completely different . Yeah .
Mm . Also means you can drop it without damaging it . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true . Um <vocalsound> you have <disfmarker> we could <disfmarker> if we could save <disfmarker> depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . Yeah . <vocalsound> I I mean it its uh I <disfmarker> that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . Mm-hmm . The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . <vocalsound> And uh the most important aspect is the l the look <disfmarker> it has to look fancy , look and feel Mm-hmm . uh instead of the current functional look and feel . This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , Mm . which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . <vocalsound> Uh exactly , yeah . sorry . Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture Uh-huh . and uh a spongy material to be used on the <vocalsound> on the outside . <vocalsound> Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . <vocalsound> Yeah . uh <vocalsound> f like it's in <disfmarker> if if fashion <disfmarker> if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . But fashions do don't last very long . Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , Yeah . Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it yeah .
yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . Mm . Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . Mm . Mm . What if we included the batteries in the cover ? Mm-hmm . Oh yeah . I like that . So um That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers like <disfmarker> I n I know <disfmarker> the only p So f I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it <disfmarker> y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together Uh yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , you probably are right . um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh <disfmarker> a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't <disfmarker> it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . Mm . Yeah , that's true . Mm . Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . Mm . Right . Mm , yeah . Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . Mm . Yeah , like they have for mobile phones Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . Yeah .
uh <disfmarker> yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh <disfmarker> a part of the f like it it <disfmarker> the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . Mm . Mm-hmm . I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh <disfmarker> I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , Mm . um w we need to decide on the <disfmarker> just the basic shape of the thing . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , Mm . you know , Oh yeah . t to deliberately get away from the uh um <vocalsound> uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um mm or uh <disfmarker> 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a <disfmarker> you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , like an <gap> . but I'd <disfmarker> yellow seems a bit of a strong colour Yeah , <vocalsound> Yeah . no , yeah . Uh no but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply <disfmarker> it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um <vocalsound> a shape that's almost like a mouse . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . So that , you know , when they hold it it's <disfmarker> because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and Yeah . Yeah . well there's the sim <disfmarker> my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape Yeah . Yeah , maybe . so that you can just sort of ho hold it . Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though Kind of a c 'cause it <disfmarker> a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . W it <disfmarker> but held , you know , Yeah . so it's <disfmarker> you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . Yeah . Yeah so <disfmarker> yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the <disfmarker> about the width of that end of the pen Yeah , and then it widens up top then wider up here . and you can fiddle an And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume yeah . Yeah . Mm . and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . Yeah , cool . that sounds <disfmarker> Um I'm just <disfmarker> I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much <disfmarker> how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? Oh yeah . <vocalsound> It is a very good point . Yeah . I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . That um the <vocalsound> we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . Mm . I th I th honest uh <vocalsound> my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . Mm I suppose , Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean <vocalsound> uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and <disfmarker> or do voice commands , and <vocalsound> either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness Uh If we we're <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . So I guess we could have a menu button as well . Yeah <vocalsound> We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? But the television would be the display Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . that <disfmarker> Yeah , and then y like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , Yeah , and you could just click that to <disfmarker> so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . Mm , oka yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh can I just get some things clear just for <vocalsound> my sake . Yeah , certainly , of course . I think I think we decided that we're gonna <disfmarker> for long term . for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , Mm . if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um <vocalsound> make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years <vocalsound> Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . And interchangeable case ? I i interchangeable case seems to be um <vocalsound> um important to the concept . Mm . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh <disfmarker> I mean uh uh this is totally new . Mm , mm-hmm . We d we don't know whether that <disfmarker> to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh <disfmarker> you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , <vocalsound> and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um the <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> I mean that's <disfmarker> no , because we've got so few buttons that it <disfmarker> that actually makes that redundant . Yeah , I think so too . <vocalsound> Yeah . As wide as possible . <disfmarker> cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh <vocalsound> you know , i i it will work most of the time um . Like this or like this . Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . Yeah ,
<vocalsound> um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . <vocalsound> Uh can I just get some things clear just for <vocalsound> my sake . and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here . <vocalsound> Yep . <vocalsound> Okay . so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . <vocalsound> Cool . So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , <vocalsound> Play with play-dough . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay , so thank you very much indeed 'Kay . Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh <disfmarker> I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word <disfmarker>
um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . <vocalsound> Uh can I just get some things clear just for <vocalsound> my sake . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at .
whether we p um <vocalsound> go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface ,
whether we p um <vocalsound> go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation .
Kate and Kendra now go away Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . So um <vocalsound> b b and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , <vocalsound> Play with play-dough . <vocalsound> Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh <disfmarker> I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word <disfmarker>
Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .
and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . and we could still keep that original idea . <vocalsound> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility
Mm . Yeah . so that you can just sort of ho hold it . Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though Kind of a c Mm-hmm . Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um <vocalsound> a shape that's almost like a mouse .
Mm . It is a very good point . Yeah . I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . Yeah , yeah . Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean <vocalsound> uh w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .
Yeah <vocalsound> We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . Yeah . So I guess we could have a menu button as well .
if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? But the television would be the display Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . that <disfmarker>
I i interchangeable case seems to be um <vocalsound> um important to the concept . Mm . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . <vocalsound> Yeah .
and we could still keep that original idea . <vocalsound> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . I mean if <disfmarker> given that the um the technology is not well developed so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , <vocalsound> Okay , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . <vocalsound> And that pretty much sums it up . and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um .
Um it <disfmarker> a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um <disfmarker> maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Mm . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? I don't actually have any price information , no . <vocalsound> And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .
Yeah , that's true . Um <vocalsound> you have <disfmarker> we could <disfmarker> if we could save <disfmarker> depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . Yeah . yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . And interchangeable case ? I i interchangeable case seems to be um <vocalsound> um important to the concept . Mm . Mm . Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . Mm . Mm . What if we included the batteries in the cover ? Mm-hmm . Oh yeah . I like that . So um That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers like <disfmarker> And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh <disfmarker> I mean uh uh this is totally new . Mm , mm-hmm . I n I know <disfmarker> the only p So f I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it <disfmarker> y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together Uh yeah . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , you probably are right . um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh <disfmarker> a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't <disfmarker> it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . Mm . Mm . Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . Yeah . Right . Mm , yeah . Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , Yeah .
<vocalsound> So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . <vocalsound> So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <vocalsound> Twenty five Euros ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's quite good price , yeah . I it's it's reasonable , And uh Is <disfmarker> it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And <vocalsound> and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know <disfmarker> I suppose you know what you have to do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I I hope so <vocalsound> And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI Yep . So <disfmarker> I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ? Okay . And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , That's me . Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me . yeah ? AMI yeah project . So I will manage all all the group . <vocalsound> you will be the manager <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> what's the difference between <vocalsound> user interface design d industrial design ? <vocalsound> Hmm . So <disfmarker> Mm . I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . Okay , You you de you implement the core functions in the <disfmarker> And i maybe you will transform it <vocalsound> . I I think the user the user interface design is <disfmarker> he will design how the user will you know <disfmarker> the relation between the user and you know the remote control so <disfmarker> Use it . Make make <disfmarker> yeah . And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . I design the user f user interface , you design the function . Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . Yeah . Okay . But <disfmarker> I was thinking that he's a user <disfmarker> 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . Yeah yeah . Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have And <disfmarker> and then thi this would <vocalsound> I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . yeah . Mm . Yeah . so really the remote control to be international . Okay . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And not too expensive . Yeah . Okay . Okay . And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . <vocalsound> It's okay ? Yeah , it's okay . You know your job ? you know your job ? <vocalsound> We have an idea yeah . <vocalsound> You know your job ? I have an idea of my job <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> yeah so . Yeah .
That's difficult . Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . No . A mouse is not too difficult . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . <vocalsound> The tool training is to try out the white board , Mm-hmm . so <disfmarker> Maybe someone ha we have to <gap> this whiteboard , yeah ? <vocalsound> Maybe you can draw your favourite animal <vocalsound> and make a list of its favourite characteristics . So right now ? I don't know if we have to do it now , So yeah I think you can do it . <vocalsound> maybe later later . Yeah , <vocalsound> Rabbit . It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A fish . Right . A fish . <vocalsound> Mm . It's clear . Yeah . <vocalsound> There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know . Is it ? <vocalsound> Are we supposed to do right now ? <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . <vocalsound> You can draw something which is very simple . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What's this ? It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a cat . It's a fat cat . <vocalsound>
And uh Mm . Is <disfmarker> it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , Yeah . Okay . so really the remote control to be international .
So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <vocalsound> Twenty five Euros ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's quite good price , yeah . I it's it's reasonable , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And not too expensive . Yeah .
Okay . Okay . And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . <vocalsound> try to create something new and people would like to to buy .
Mm . I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . Okay , You you de you implement the core functions in the <disfmarker> And i maybe you will transform it <vocalsound> . I I think the user the user interface design is <disfmarker> he will design how the user will you know <disfmarker> the relation between the user and you know the remote control so <disfmarker> Use it . Make make <disfmarker> yeah . And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . I design the user f user interface , you design the function . Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . Yeah . Okay . But <disfmarker> I was thinking that he's a user <disfmarker> 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . Yeah yeah . and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI Yep . what's the difference between <vocalsound> user interface design d industrial design ? <vocalsound> Hmm . So <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up . This is our functional design meeting . Um . Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up . Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um <disfmarker> just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . Um . I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um <disfmarker> did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you . I'm also putting 'em <disfmarker> them in the shared folder . Yep . So um then I <disfmarker> we'll talk about our general objectives Right . and have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . So <disfmarker> First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the <gap> functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . Okay ,
People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal Alright , so , Alright . I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . But , Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly <vocalsound> , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they <disfmarker> more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . 'Kay . that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before Hmm . just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know . Repetitive strain injury . What ? Repetitive strain injury . <gap> So if you <disfmarker> People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .
Mm . A fashion fashion remote . I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . Right . Here we go . Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , adjust the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about <vocalsound> h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . and different different people sort of prefer different things . Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . Hmm . Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . Mm 'kay .
Hmm . So I had a look on the <disfmarker> on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things <disfmarker> what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . <vocalsound> Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , <vocalsound> so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can <disfmarker> you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our <disfmarker> find a way of striking a balance between the two .
This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . Mm-hmm . And <vocalsound> personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around There are Y_s <gap> . Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of <disfmarker> some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's <disfmarker> we're still in early stages . this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the <disfmarker> what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . That'll be fine . So the findings that I got uh very <disfmarker> just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls <disfmarker> that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components
Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . Um . Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um <disfmarker> of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things Mm-hmm . who are we aiming this at ? Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion <disfmarker> we put the fashion in in electronics then you <disfmarker> automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> who's gonna be attracted to this . <vocalsound> Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? Mm-hmm . 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . Right . Right , okay . The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . Mm-hmm . but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . Now , those are <disfmarker> that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? Um . Mm . I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying To produce it , yes . And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . Mm . right . Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , If <vocalsound> <disfmarker> they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno . we can look for <disfmarker> we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly . Yeah , simplification . Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , mm . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or <disfmarker> I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , and there's all the <disfmarker> all the special buttons . Mm-hmm . 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them Mm-hmm . Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? I <disfmarker> what in this project ? Si simplicity and fashion . I think simplicity , fashion . speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , Mm-hmm . What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , Um . like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering . I think it's a lot <vocalsound> to do with battery , Okay . The battery and that <disfmarker> I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . Mm-hmm . So 's just the quality of the chip . Yeah . I think so . So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing <disfmarker> S voice recognition , Yeah . and it might be too expensive . <gap> And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote Mm-hmm . you'd just talk to your T_V_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , Ooh . <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> I I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything Yeah , <gap> but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . Um . I'd say we're <disfmarker> uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? It's it's hard to narrow it down . It's really hard to figure out right now . I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . Mm-hmm . I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , Okay . Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of Yeah . Mm . So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <disfmarker> Yeah , t probably . Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions <disfmarker> do we want something so that <disfmarker> do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Mm . Yeah . Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . Mm . It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , Mm . we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . Yep . Yeah . And <vocalsound> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . Yeah . Yeah . Large , accessible buttons for the essentials . We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ? Battery battery use . So you never have to change the battery . Yeah . We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery , I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . Yeah , without the energy , yeah . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah . You could <disfmarker> Yeah . I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <vocalsound> it stays in one place . Mm-hmm . okay , that's <vocalsound> that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Okay , yeah , it's fine . Okay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . Okay . We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um <disfmarker> well it <disfmarker> that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um <disfmarker> we're not gonna worry about that . What's teletext ? Um . Uh , it's a British thing . Oh . Oh , Um yeah , it's like a <disfmarker> I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . <gap> How ? Oh . It's earl it's pretty old technology . It's like nineteen eighties . Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . Right . Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time . 'Kay . Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . Mm . So what's our corporate image like ? It's <disfmarker> It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that <disfmarker> the emphasis on the R_s in um <disfmarker> It's like double R_ . mm-hmm .
I don't know what summarisation . Yep . 'kay . Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries <disfmarker> summary .
I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .
Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .
After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . Um you each have individual actions ,
If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept ,
<vocalsound> Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept ,
<vocalsound> market trend wa watching . And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . User Interface , the user interface concept ,
and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . Okay . We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um <disfmarker> well it <disfmarker> that's been taken over by the internet ,
Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . Right .
We only have a a short amount of time . 'Kay . Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . Mm .
Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? I <disfmarker> what in this project ? Si simplicity and fashion . I think simplicity , fashion .
Well maybe we can define it by like the demographic of Yeah . Mm . So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <disfmarker> Yeah , t probably . It's it's hard to narrow it down . It's really hard to figure out right now . I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . Mm-hmm . I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , Okay . Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? I <disfmarker> what in this project ? Si simplicity and fashion . I think simplicity , fashion . maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,
So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . Yep . we have about four minutes left to define our functions .
Yep . Yeah . And <vocalsound> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . Yeah .
We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .
and there's all the <disfmarker> all the special buttons . Mm-hmm . 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them Mm-hmm . I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , Yeah . Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features .
okay , that's <vocalsound> that's a good idea , we'll keep it . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . Yeah , without the energy , yeah . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .
who are we aiming this at ? Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion <disfmarker> we put the fashion in in electronics then you <disfmarker> automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> who's gonna be attracted to this . <vocalsound> Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? Mm-hmm . The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . Mm-hmm . but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing <disfmarker> S voice recognition , Yeah . Yeah , <gap> but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . Um . I'd say we're <disfmarker> uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? It's it's hard to narrow it down . It's really hard to figure out right now .
those are <disfmarker> that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? Um . Mm . I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying To produce it , yes . And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . Mm . and it might be too expensive . <gap> And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote Mm-hmm . you'd just talk to your T_V_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , Ooh . <vocalsound>
speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , Mm-hmm . What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , Um . like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering . I think it's a lot <vocalsound> to do with battery , Okay . The battery and that <disfmarker> I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . Mm-hmm . So 's just the quality of the chip . Yeah . I think so .
I dunno , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ? Battery battery use . that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <vocalsound> it stays in one place . Mm-hmm . So you never have to change the battery . Yeah . We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery , I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . Yeah , without the energy , yeah . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah . You could <disfmarker> Yeah .
Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . <gap>
<gap> coffee . <vocalsound> 'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh <vocalsound> uh our aspects from the last meeting . Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . The logo is uh is uh <vocalsound> is pretty uh <vocalsound> obvious to see on the on the remote control , <vocalsound> Maybe you can uh point them uh <disfmarker> The functions . Uh , well the uh <disfmarker> all the functions are discussed uh <disfmarker> I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Oh . Do y do you <disfmarker> Yeah . did we want to have a m mute button ? But uh that <disfmarker> It's uh here then , in the middle . Yeah . Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . Huh . But we have to look n I don't know . the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , <vocalsound> Well , yeah mo uh mo Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the <disfmarker> on <disfmarker> Most of the users Yeah . Then your uh left thumb of uh <disfmarker> your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . <vocalsound> And other lights ? I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . No , o on the on the front . I don't like the colours . yeah , uh there's nothing <disfmarker> We came uh <disfmarker> I think it's pretty basic , the the <disfmarker> there's no fu Yes . there's one there's one button , No nothing really trendy about it . because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Mm-hmm . and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb .
Uh , power button . Uh then the the the nine uh channels . <vocalsound> Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . No , <vocalsound> we'll apply them then for now . Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh <vocalsound> do uh like <vocalsound> uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers . Yes . All n no , that's um <vocalsound> kinda dependent on the television . Yeah , true , yeah . Yeah , Uh <disfmarker> but do we have <disfmarker> do we need extra buttons , <vocalsound> for example some uh some have to <disfmarker> Yeah , I think you should add <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Zero ? A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . May maybe here ? Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , yes . becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds <disfmarker> Yeah . And then a second . No , that's dependent on the television . No , I don't think so . because you have a <disfmarker> I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty <disfmarker> uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . Yes , but but a lot <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . No , I think <disfmarker> uh I really think it's n because you can <disfmarker> when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , Yeah . Yes , but some televisions don't accept uh that that <disfmarker> Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . Yeah . I think it works that way , really . No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . <vocalsound> Yeah , but it's exact the same <gap> that w would appear when you put a separate button <disfmarker> push a separate button . Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . Yep . <vocalsound> True . Listen , with <disfmarker> that that's that special but button <gap> you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in <disfmarker> on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you <disfmarker> the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had <disfmarker> No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No , But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it <disfmarker> No , that's not true . It's simply not true . It's simply not true . yes it it is . Yeah , but I m uh but it's <disfmarker> I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . Yeah , it <disfmarker> But okay , we we'll impl No , definitely not . Definitely not . We'll discuss them in the usability lab . No , Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . Yeah ? I think it's more c is m maybe we don't <disfmarker> uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten <disfmarker> Th won't work wi with uh <disfmarker> No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . to have that special button .
Yeah , that's true , but uh <disfmarker> When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . Yes , but uh I I g Just have to be big enough for the biggest <disfmarker> Shouldn't it fall then ? It <disfmarker> isn't going to fall down ? <vocalsound> That's a bit uh <disfmarker> yeah , I think <disfmarker> No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . But then it's a little bit <disfmarker> like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , But it's just an idea . I won't draw it really . Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big <gap> <disfmarker> But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . Yeah . Yes , little holer <disfmarker> littler <disfmarker> Uh , little products go deeper in it . Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues <vocalsound> still to come . Yeah , sure , you're right . but I still think i it it <disfmarker> all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , The button . because Real <vocalsound> Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . Yep . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , of course . when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yes , but we can make <disfmarker> The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
Yes . That's it ? Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . The light . oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Yes . Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . And they're be a <disfmarker> <gap> they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . Yes . Yeah . Uh , in the same colour as the side . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . it's depends on the costs and such . Yeah . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important ,
We <disfmarker> we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . Yeah . Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh <disfmarker> yeah . I I th But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . A th a three . oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ? Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . No . We're not <disfmarker> No . No . No , not L_C_D_ , so . well , maybe the the the <disfmarker> on the side . Yeah , but we uh <disfmarker> <gap> you mean the rubber stuff ? Yeah , and the light . Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . And the light maybe . But that that's not innovative . But <disfmarker> No , six . Well , six . Or seven maybe , <vocalsound> yeah . No , six . Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe <disfmarker> With the lights it <disfmarker> it's it's kind of future <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . N no no , Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i <gap> yeah . Okay . No ? No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we <disfmarker> Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev <gap> how would you innovate a remote control more ? Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and <disfmarker> To put it on your head . yeah . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , that's that's <disfmarker> think about it la later on but <disfmarker> and uh <disfmarker> Remote control is easy to use . <vocalsound> Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . Yes . Yeah , a two . Yes . I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . Remote control will be bought by <disfmarker> It will be bought by people under the age of forty . Yes . Yeah . Definitely . Yes . No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two . We don't know . Right , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . Oh no . Can we see the slogan ? The logo . Yeah , you can put that on the side if <vocalsound> if we would like to . A logo . Underneath it or something . Yes , uh encrypted uh with <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Are we gonna do that ? Because of the slogan <gap> <disfmarker> And uh <disfmarker> Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . Uh , it's a one or a two . Yes . Two ? Yeah , make it a two . Two . Um <disfmarker> Go away . Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . <vocalsound> Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . <vocalsound> Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of <gap> , our design . I don't know or uh I don't know how you <disfmarker> How do you guys feel ? I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own <disfmarker> Casting . Yeah . Okay . more to your own personality or or house style . Yeah , but we d we didn't <disfmarker> we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . No , not not fronts , but different designs . With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh <disfmarker> three is uh a bit uh <disfmarker> Okay , three . oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . Yeah . Yeah well , let that <disfmarker> let's make that a one . <vocalsound> Yes . I'm the I'm the usability , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . Yes . Yeah , two or a one , I guess . The <disfmarker> It's something we really put work into . Yeah , I <disfmarker> yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . It's all about the buttons . That's a one ? You agree ? Yeah . The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . But <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . Oh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true . That's true . And telete Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , Yeah , we don't know if the <disfmarker> uh they're necessary . Yes . The remote control has got a really trendy look . <vocalsound> Yes . A one . Maarten . Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Well .
We <disfmarker> we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . Yeah . Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh <disfmarker> yeah . I I th But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . A th a three . oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ? Yeah . No , not L_C_D_ , so . well , maybe the the the <disfmarker> on the side . Yeah , but we uh <disfmarker> <gap> you mean the rubber stuff ? Yeah , and the light . Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . And the light maybe . But that that's not innovative . But <disfmarker> No , six . Well , six . Or seven maybe , <vocalsound> yeah . No , six . Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe <disfmarker> With the lights it <disfmarker> it's it's kind of future <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . N no no , Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i <gap> yeah . Okay . No ? No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we <disfmarker> Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev <gap> how would you innovate a remote control more ? Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and <disfmarker> To put it on your head . yeah . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , that's that's <disfmarker> think about it la later on but <disfmarker> Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . Yes . Yeah , a two . Yes . It will be bought by people under the age of forty . Yes . Yeah . Definitely . Yes . No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two . We don't know . Can we see the slogan ? The logo . Yeah , you can put that on the side if <vocalsound> if we would like to . A logo . Underneath it or something . Yes , uh encrypted uh with <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Are we gonna do that ? Yes . Two ? Yeah , make it a two . Two . Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of <gap> , our design . Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh <disfmarker> three is uh a bit uh <disfmarker> Okay , three . oh , what am I doing ? The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . Yeah . Yeah well , let that <disfmarker> let's make that a one . <vocalsound> Yes . Yeah , two or a one , I guess . The <disfmarker> It's something we really put work into . Yeah , I <disfmarker> yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . It's all about the buttons . The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . But <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . Oh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true . That's true . And telete Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , Yeah , we don't know if the <disfmarker> uh they're necessary . Yes . The remote control has got a really trendy look . <vocalsound> Yes . A one . Maarten . Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Well .
Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . Twenty six . It's a two point six . It's not that bad . when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , Yeah . True . which is uh quite a great score . Okay .
yeah , but when we skip when we um <disfmarker> when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still <disfmarker> yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature . We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . Yeah . Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe <disfmarker> Wi wi without recharge <disfmarker> It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . It isn't in my information , I uh I <disfmarker> I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> You can look at it for s presentation . S technical functions ? <vocalsound> Mm . I don't think here <disfmarker> it's in here already . It's circuit board . Mm <disfmarker> Uh , this is n this is not this n Was it working design or components design ? Sorry . Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . The display requires an advanced chip . You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Ah , okay . Okay , so we only need a simple chip . Requires . That's not needed . A scroll-wheel <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them . I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . Yeah , I agree . And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . Yeah . Twelve Euros and fifty cents . So we're gonna use the simple chip . So , simple chip is okay . category . <vocalsound> Nah , there is some money left to be spent . Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't <disfmarker> it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated <disfmarker> innovative te technology anyway , I think . Mm-hmm . Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one <disfmarker> We can make a docking station for two thirty . Wow , w why no li That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . <vocalsound> Wi with a button to Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the <disfmarker> these costs of the speaker and other stuff . I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . <vocalsound> Well then it's a useless project . Look at the case , Oh , because we <gap> <disfmarker> the case the case of of uh of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . We <disfmarker> well look at all the special stuff we have . <vocalsound> No . Yeah , I don <vocalsound> Can't we uh <disfmarker> Uh maybe it <disfmarker> with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . Can't we say fifteen Euros ? <vocalsound> Uh , no . No , sta yeah <gap> I mean <disfmarker> Okay , finance . Because um <vocalsound> Shoot . I received uh a spreadsheet . A five . A five . <vocalsound> No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . No . I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a <gap> . No , we only make less profit of it . It's the <disfmarker> You can sell for twenty seven and a half . Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . <gap> I probably have already opened it here . <gap> try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain The amount , yeah . we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips <disfmarker> Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . Okay . But <gap> <disfmarker> The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh <disfmarker> my my my uh <disfmarker> The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip <disfmarker> maybe . Yeah . I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? Bec No , the <disfmarker> they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . Maybe you can uh look it up right now . Okay , but <disfmarker> okay . Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . Okay . That will be enough for future uh recommendations . Yeah , but it will it will it will be <disfmarker> cause a lot of problems . <vocalsound> The sample sensor <disfmarker> sample speaker . I don't know it uh either . Okay , we went for the double-curved case Yes . made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . I guess that's what we were <disfmarker> Well , special colour . <gap> . Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . but I think w uh <disfmarker> I don't know if it's very special . I don't <disfmarker> Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . Mm okay . Standard rubber . Alright , that's okay . Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . St <vocalsound> Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? it's a little <disfmarker> Yes . Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . <vocalsound> That's huge . No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . Yeah . Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the <gap> and the total cost <disfmarker> I don't know . Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . I You can have f four kind of push-buttons . Rubber . Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . Yes , yes . Celebration . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . I think that <disfmarker> Eighteen . One two three four five , si Why is that so uh expensive . Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . So , whe when you <disfmarker> so then it <disfmarker> No way . Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I can't <disfmarker> I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . It's way <disfmarker> But whe <vocalsound> I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , No , really . Yeah , we could skip the numbers . but but <disfmarker> Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . That's still four . Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , Okay , we'll we'll just <disfmarker> okay . But then still , <vocalsound> when we <disfmarker> there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh <disfmarker> oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it <disfmarker> this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . <vocalsound> A special colour , why a special colour ? Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . But wha what s what special ? I don't think the special form is really true . Uh , yeah . I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it <disfmarker> Plastic . Oh , plastic . 'Kay , but the problem now is that <vocalsound> the <disfmarker> There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . Yeah . <vocalsound> But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It uh <disfmarker> but it <disfmarker> then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can <disfmarker> No . No , but you <disfmarker> otherwise you can't retrieve it . but then you still have to use <disfmarker> we have to find out what chip we u need . Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . I think we can agree on this . Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean <disfmarker> But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . I think so , too . I mean i i if you <disfmarker> if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . But what what can we do <disfmarker> Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know <disfmarker>
yeah , but when we skip when we um <disfmarker> when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still <disfmarker> yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature . We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . Yeah . Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe <disfmarker> Wi wi without recharge <disfmarker> It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . It isn't in my information , I uh I <disfmarker> I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> You can look at it for s presentation . S technical functions ? <vocalsound> Mm . I don't think here <disfmarker> it's in here already . It's circuit board . Mm <disfmarker> Uh , this is n this is not this n Was it working design or components design ? Sorry . Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . The display requires an advanced chip . You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Ah , okay . Okay , so we only need a simple chip . Requires . That's not needed . A scroll-wheel <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them . Nah , there is some money left to be spent . Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .

Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one <disfmarker> We can make a docking station for two thirty .

You have to make people buy it and uh <disfmarker> We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not <disfmarker> Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . Okay . That will be enough for future uh recommendations .

Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know <disfmarker>
then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . Yeah , it's great . You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . <vocalsound> No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . No . Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . Why don't we use solar cells then ? Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and <disfmarker> That's true . Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what <disfmarker> that would just have a lack of key features , you know . Oui . No , that's true . maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . Instead of the rechargeable <disfmarker> the rechargeable thing was something to um <disfmarker> know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I <disfmarker> they will think about that . I mean if you u Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . The uh <disfmarker> it's made for s people <disfmarker> And i it it <disfmarker> th th the the target Or the hand dynamo dynamo <disfmarker> the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking <gap> . <vocalsound> Because I think it <disfmarker> when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one <disfmarker> it gets thrown around <gap> thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot <disfmarker> Hey that <disfmarker> maybe that's cool <disfmarker> that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . Yeah , but but if we ca It <disfmarker> th this is whole concept . <vocalsound> Can't we uh <disfmarker> Uh maybe it <disfmarker> with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . Can't we say fifteen Euros ? Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . No .
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . No no , it's not possible . Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro .
<vocalsound> No . Yes , yes . Celebration . Yes . We can't do anything else . Warning , finish meeting now . We're done . Okay , project e uh Is this it ? well , we were gonna what look <disfmarker> take a look at the last sheet . Yeah , <vocalsound> sure . Okay . No , we can't . <vocalsound> Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
I don't see why , but <disfmarker> Where's the champagne ? I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . Yeah ?
Twelve Euros and fifty cents . So we're gonna use the simple chip . So , simple chip is okay .
The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what <disfmarker> that would just have a lack of key features , you know . Oui .
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . No no , it's not possible . Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh <vocalsound> do uh like <vocalsound> uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers . Yes . All n no , that's um <vocalsound> kinda dependent on the television . Yeah , true , yeah . Yeah , Uh <disfmarker> but do we have <disfmarker> do we need extra buttons , <vocalsound> for example some uh some have to <disfmarker> Yeah , I think you should add <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Zero ? A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . May maybe here ? Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , yes . becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds <disfmarker> Yeah . And then a second . No , that's dependent on the television . No , I don't think so . because you have a <disfmarker> I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty <disfmarker> uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . Yes , but but a lot <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . No , I think <disfmarker> uh I really think it's n because you can <disfmarker> when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , Yeah . Yes , but some televisions don't accept uh that that <disfmarker> Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . Yeah . I think it works that way , really . No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . <vocalsound> Yeah , but it's exact the same <gap> that w would appear when you put a separate button <disfmarker> push a separate button . Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . Yep . <vocalsound> True . Listen , with <disfmarker> that that's that special but button <gap> you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in <disfmarker> on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you <disfmarker> the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had <disfmarker> No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No , But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it <disfmarker> No , that's not true . It's simply not true . It's simply not true . yes it it is . Yeah , but I m uh but it's <disfmarker> I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . Yeah , it <disfmarker> But okay , we we'll impl No , definitely not . Definitely not . We'll discuss them in the usability lab . No , <vocalsound> we'll apply them then for now . Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . Yeah ? but I still think i it it <disfmarker> all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . No , no . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't <disfmarker> uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten <disfmarker> Th won't work wi with uh <disfmarker> No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . to have that special button .
Yeah , that's true , but uh <disfmarker> When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . Yes , but uh I I g Just have to be big enough for the biggest <disfmarker> Shouldn't it fall then ? It <disfmarker> isn't going to fall down ? <vocalsound> That's a bit uh <disfmarker> yeah , I think <disfmarker> No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . But then it's a little bit <disfmarker> like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , But it's just an idea . I won't draw it really . Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big <gap> <disfmarker> But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . Yeah . Yes , little holer <disfmarker> littler <disfmarker> Uh , little products go deeper in it . Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues <vocalsound> still to come . Yeah , sure , you're right . that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , The button . because Real <vocalsound> Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . Yep . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , of course . when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yes , but we can make <disfmarker> The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
Oh , plastic . 'Kay , but the problem now is that <vocalsound> the <disfmarker> There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . Yeah . <vocalsound> But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It uh <disfmarker> but it <disfmarker> then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can <disfmarker> <gap> I probably have already opened it here . <gap> try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . But let's let's st start with beginning . Plastic .
it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips <disfmarker> Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . Okay . But <gap> <disfmarker> The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh <disfmarker> I don't know <disfmarker> Where did we find this information ? I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . Was it <disfmarker> my my my uh <disfmarker> The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip <disfmarker> maybe . Yeah . I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? Bec No , the <disfmarker> they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . Maybe you can uh look it up right now . Okay , but <disfmarker> okay . It isn't in my information , I uh I <disfmarker> I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> You can look at it for s presentation . Alright , S technical functions ? well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . Okay . That will be enough for future uh recommendations . Yeah , but it will it will it will be <disfmarker> cause a lot of problems . <vocalsound> The sample sensor <disfmarker> sample speaker . <vocalsound> Mm . I don't think here <disfmarker> it's in here already . It's circuit board . That's not needed . Mm <disfmarker> Uh , this is n this is not this n Was it working design or components design ? Sorry . Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . The display requires an advanced chip . You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Ah , okay . Okay , so we only need a simple chip . Requires . A scroll-wheel <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> I can't <disfmarker> I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . It's way <disfmarker> But whe <vocalsound> I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , No , really . Yeah , we could skip the numbers . but but <disfmarker> Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . That's still four . Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . St <vocalsound> Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? it's a little <disfmarker> Yes . Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . <vocalsound> That's huge . No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . Yeah . Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the <gap> and the total cost <disfmarker> I don't know . Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . I You can have f four kind of push-buttons . Rubber . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . I think that <disfmarker> Eighteen . One two three four five , si Why is that so uh expensive . Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . So , whe when you <disfmarker> so then it <disfmarker> No way . Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of <disfmarker>
yeah , but when we skip when we um <disfmarker> when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still <disfmarker> yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature . We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . Yeah . Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe <disfmarker> Wi wi without recharge <disfmarker> It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . Nah , there is some money left to be spent . Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? You m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh <disfmarker> We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not <disfmarker> the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . No no , it's not possible . Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one <disfmarker> We can make a docking station for two thirty . Wow , w why no li <vocalsound> Wi with a button to <vocalsound> It uh <disfmarker> but it <disfmarker> then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can <disfmarker> No . No , but you <disfmarker> otherwise you can't retrieve it . but then you still have to use <disfmarker> we have to find out what chip we u need . Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . I think we can agree on this . That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean <disfmarker> But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . I think so , too . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the <disfmarker> these costs of the speaker and other stuff . I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . I mean i i if you <disfmarker> if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it .
then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . Yeah , it's great . You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . <vocalsound> No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . No . Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . Why don't we use solar cells then ? Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and <disfmarker> That's true . Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what <disfmarker> that would just have a lack of key features , you know . Oui . No , that's true . maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . Instead of the rechargeable <disfmarker> the rechargeable thing was something to um <disfmarker> know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I <disfmarker> they will think about that . I mean if you u Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . The uh <disfmarker> it's made for s people <disfmarker> And i it it <disfmarker> th th the the target Or the hand dynamo dynamo <disfmarker> the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking <gap> . <vocalsound> Because I think it <disfmarker> when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one <disfmarker> it gets thrown around <gap> thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot <disfmarker> Hey that <disfmarker> maybe that's cool <disfmarker> that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . Yeah , but but if we ca It <disfmarker> th this is whole concept . <vocalsound> Can't we uh <disfmarker> Uh maybe it <disfmarker> with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . Can't we say fifteen Euros ? Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . No .
Our remote control . We come back tomorrow , okay ? Yeah . <vocalsound> No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . Yes . No , but <disfmarker> no . That's what it's <disfmarker> makes it special . Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , Yeah . <vocalsound> No , we won't , but that's um something else . But now <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It w it won't tell , but <disfmarker> No , this not gonna sell . No . Huh , any ideas ? No , uh , n no Great <gap> . It's great . Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .
<vocalsound> No . Yes , yes . Celebration . Yes . We can't do anything else . Warning , finish meeting now . We're done . Okay , project e uh Is this it ? well , we were gonna what look <disfmarker> take a look at the last sheet . Yeah , <vocalsound> sure . Okay . No , we can't . <vocalsound> Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ Oh . and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . so we uh have to go on . <vocalsound> Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . Mm-hmm . It's quite logical al all of it . Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . Oh . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um <disfmarker>
because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Oh , that's a shame . So that's a shame ,
Right . Alright ? And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um <disfmarker> They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . Um , <vocalsound> that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .
Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh <vocalsound> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Yeah . Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <vocalsound> in their living room . <vocalsound>
Uh the user interface is um <vocalsound> uh the <vocalsound> the <gap> the buttons of course . <vocalsound> And the <vocalsound> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , So <vocalsound> well you understand . <vocalsound> The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . <vocalsound> Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , Yeah .
I like user-centred . Yeah , me too . I like user-centr centred uh <vocalsound> uh also the best . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur .
No . Alright . Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? It will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . No not clickable . Well maybe . Uh well I think so , yes . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Like a ticker-tape .
Alright , let's keep it central . <vocalsound> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Channel , yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Volume ? Volume control . Yes . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Uh the mute button . Well let's look at your uh design . Uh <disfmarker> Oh the Okay button ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Yeah . Yeah , alright . Menu button . You should <disfmarker> Yeah . I think that's important . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> And and the settings to change the brightness <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Channel , yeah . <gap> But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time .
Okay . You say familiarity isn't important but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So <disfmarker> Your pen . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . We're going to uh go to our uh rooms ,
And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than <disfmarker> I think . Well we are a design team ,
Uh you can draw it if you <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh make someone w
I like user-centred . Yeah , me too . I like user-centr centred uh <vocalsound> uh also the best . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur .
No . Alright . Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? It will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . No not clickable . Well maybe . Uh well I think so , yes . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Like a ticker-tape .
Alright , let's keep it central . <vocalsound> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Channel , yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Volume ? Volume control . Yes . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Uh the mute button . Well let's look at your uh design . Uh <disfmarker> Oh the Okay button ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Yeah . Yeah , alright . Menu button . You should <disfmarker> Yeah . I think that's important . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> And and the settings to change the brightness <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Channel , yeah . <gap>
Th that's the most <disfmarker> Alright so no button for that . Yeah . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? No .
And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . Oh yeah . Uh just two just two under uh under uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Th that's a bit uh waste . We we can make <vocalsound> make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . <vocalsound> Or at <disfmarker> But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Yeah alright then .
Nei not too much , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So <disfmarker> I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Well for example the power button , Well teletext is not an option , so that uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Yeah , I think we we should use something like this um to um <disfmarker> The the channel up and channel down button ? <vocalsound> Yeah , in circle , you know ? Yes . No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . But <disfmarker> Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <vocalsound> t kinda true . When <gap> <vocalsound> when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , <vocalsound> and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Apart . because all my i important buttons are the same place . Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah that's true . That's very irritating , I think . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . <vocalsound> Volume hardly . Uh-huh . So the the <vocalsound> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . No I don't think . <vocalsound> Oh .
Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh well I think so , yes . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 'Kay . Um , <vocalsound> that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh <disfmarker> I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh <disfmarker> It's going to be expensive . Yeah . No . Um there are two target audi audiences , Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nigh and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . Mm . Right . Alright ? And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that's uh difficult to realise also . Yeah , but <vocalsound> it <vocalsound> it might be important for the sale . but what kind of features ? Yeah I think <vocalsound> m most <disfmarker> Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . Yeah but <disfmarker> Yeah .
So when you s <vocalsound> you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top . Yeah . Yeah . Huh ? With the remote ? Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . That thing is terrible . Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , And and we can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . Yeah . but we we we we don't want that . Yeah you don't want <disfmarker> We don't want them to look like a calculator . You want uh <disfmarker> Yeah it it it must be a remote . just at at the top . Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We White ? <vocalsound> I think it's still important to have it at the top , Width .
Nei not too much , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So <disfmarker> I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Well for example the power button , Well teletext is not an option , so that uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Yeah , I think we we should use something like this um to um <disfmarker> The the channel up and channel down button ? <vocalsound> Yeah , in circle , you know ? Yes . No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . But <disfmarker> Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <vocalsound> t kinda true . When <gap> <vocalsound> when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , <vocalsound> and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Apart . because all my i important buttons are the same place . Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah that's true . That's very irritating , I think . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . <vocalsound> Volume hardly . Uh-huh . So the the <vocalsound> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . No I don't think . <vocalsound> Oh .
Uh there's um <vocalsound> screen . You can make it wider and less wide . Yeah . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . Right . Go to video , that's always on your remote control . Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh <disfmarker> To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .
Hello Um <vocalsound> like before we uh <disfmarker> I have to redo the meetings from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> n th the minutes from the last meeting Mm-hmm . and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um . But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh <vocalsound> thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . She would like uh <disfmarker> this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with <disfmarker> to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .
Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm . of this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Yes . And at the end , it <disfmarker> this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . Okay . Yeah . Uh so this is our <disfmarker> what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . Mm-hmm . Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive Mm-hmm . um and it's <disfmarker> it's blue in colour Mm-hmm . uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons Mm-hmm . so it is a <disfmarker> uh uh a <disfmarker> looks-wise it is beautiful . Mm-hmm . Uh and also compact in shape . Mm-hmm . and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the <disfmarker> Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als And then um uh for the <disfmarker> for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . Mm-hmm . Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Mm-hmm . on the side of the model . Mm-hmm . Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes <disfmarker> the different channels . Mm-hmm . We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . Mm-hmm . And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . Mm . Now our <disfmarker> our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . What kind of button ?
Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . Mm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm . A shell shape . For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual <disfmarker> Okay , well um what <disfmarker> what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , Yes , yes . I think voice recognition is our big selling point Mm . uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . You know . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . Colours . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . That's that's a really good good thing . Mm-hmm . Abs okay . The colour's very attractive . Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? Yes , it will have uh <disfmarker> these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . Ah .
Yes . Mm-hmm . And then we have to interface push buttons . Yes . Mm ? Eight , eight point two . Nine points , Eight point two , right ? So , we <disfmarker> looks like we are well within budget . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . Yes . Oh go away . Um kinetic source so that's <disfmarker> in the energy source that's all we need . Mm-hmm . Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? Single curve ? Mm . I guess it's double curved . Double curved ?
Mm-hmm . Um I just realised one thing . Yes . In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . Yes .
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . Yeah , And so we've got <disfmarker> we've still got four euros to go <disfmarker> to spend . We have um four euros , yeah I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean <vocalsound> four thirty . Mm-hmm .
I'll give three . yeah ? Three . Uh maybe two , Two , okay . yeah . And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . but um <disfmarker> I'll give it a three . Okay . Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . Worse , okay . One , okay , and Be Betsy ? Yes I think uh shape is one . Yeah , even my <disfmarker> yeah , shape is one . Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size <disfmarker> I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average . Um , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two . Okay . <vocalsound> Um and then how about <disfmarker> how we doing on colour ? Colour uh I <disfmarker> Colour , I gave it a one . One . Yeah , one . One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . I gave it a three , two ,
Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? Uh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? Maybe we can <disfmarker> We can always improve , yes . yeah , include some more buttons and uh um We can make the buttons <disfmarker> few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . Mm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um <vocalsound> do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So that that's where we're gonna have to do <disfmarker> maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I <disfmarker> I thank you all very much . Um , I think this was very good Uh I think <disfmarker> personally I think uh I'm pretty happy . I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , it's something I think I can market . Yeah . Yeah . and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? <vocalsound> I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> And I think team work I think was very very good , Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm . I think we really <disfmarker> We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , Whiteboard more , yes , yes . I think we were we were very good , yeah , mm . I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here . Mm-hmm .
um and it's <disfmarker> it's blue in colour Mm-hmm . uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons Mm-hmm . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . Mm-hmm . Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm . so it is a <disfmarker> uh uh a <disfmarker> looks-wise it is beautiful . Mm-hmm . Uh and also compact in shape .
Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . Mm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm . A shell shape . For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm ,
and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the <disfmarker> Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als
Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm . of this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . Mm-hmm . Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Mm-hmm . on the side of the model . Mm-hmm . Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes <disfmarker> the different channels . Mm-hmm . We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . Mm-hmm . And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . Mm . Now our <disfmarker> our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . What kind of button ?
Yes , it will have uh <disfmarker> these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . Ah . uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
And then um uh for the <disfmarker> for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green Mm-hmm .
Mm ? Eight , eight point two . Nine points , Um I just realised one thing . Yes . In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . Yes .
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . Yeah , And so we've got <disfmarker> we've still got four euros to go <disfmarker> to spend . We have um four euros , yeah I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean <vocalsound> four thirty . Mm-hmm .
Mm ? Eight , eight point two . Nine points , Mm-hmm . Um I just realised one thing . Yes . Eight point two , right ? So , we <disfmarker> looks like we are well within budget . Yeah . In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . Yes . And so we've got <disfmarker> we've still got four euros to go <disfmarker> to spend . We have um four euros , yeah I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean <vocalsound> four thirty . Mm-hmm .
Yeah , So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
<vocalsound> Oh man . <vocalsound> So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my <disfmarker> that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . Oh and I'm <disfmarker> therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um <vocalsound> just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh <disfmarker> last meeting was that <vocalsound> um we that we had meetings from <disfmarker> uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some <disfmarker> mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . <vocalsound> So .
um , go ahead and take it away guys . Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see Mm-hmm . and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fair enough . <vocalsound> Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . <vocalsound> Perfect . Go ahead . it's important to <vocalsound> we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces Mm . and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity Right . Appropriate , okay . Um . Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable <vocalsound> and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued Mm 'kay . but this is kind of something that can be done It is an option . um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . <vocalsound> Oh , right . Ah . I see . Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , <vocalsound> let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . <vocalsound> Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? Um I worried about the materials , it is uh <disfmarker> the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . <vocalsound> Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , Oh It's pos a possible new product . Okay . Um , but I think that's <disfmarker> I think that sums up the main features of our <disfmarker> of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions Right . or f whether that uh <disfmarker> whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ? Uh we did , yeah . This cost <disfmarker> well to put this into um production , we're looking at about <disfmarker> what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . <vocalsound> One thing that we didn't do um <disfmarker> obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button Mm . and that's what helped keep the cost down . Brilliant . So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , Mm . in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote Okay . and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . Mm . <vocalsound> Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? And <disfmarker> Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console <vocalsound> Okay . and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Yeah . Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier Mm 'kay . and um , I think that uh has given a proven um <vocalsound> ease of use and what not . Hmm . Yeah . And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . Right . Cool . Any questions ? <vocalsound> Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? No , no <vocalsound> In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? Um , do you wanna answer this one Well we didn't quite have enough material uh <vocalsound> . Oh Um , well <vocalsound> as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like <disfmarker> Okay . yeah . Okay . Right . Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips Mm-hmm . and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . And the whole thing <disfmarker> So I mean there are <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> we definitely priced out a spongy <disfmarker> even spongier non-natural look um materials Yeah . which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool . It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate Okay . because it's simple enough that in the factory it could <disfmarker> we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Okay . It's still an option if we need it . Yeah . Very cool , nice job . Right , yeah
I like it , brilliant . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me <disfmarker> you've got <disfmarker> you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Oh . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts <vocalsound> and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . Ooh . So we'll just <disfmarker> if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this <disfmarker> it's a solar cell thing right ? Right uh we didn't really touch on that With a back-up battery ? but it it's in there , With the ba okay . Um and <disfmarker> The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that <disfmarker> be the general <disfmarker> one big curve I guess you could say . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? special . yeah . And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , <vocalsound> So it looks like M come in at sixteen ? a bit over budget , um . Oh . Huh , So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells <vocalsound> um or take out the back-up battery . Uh <disfmarker> How do you feel about that ? I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that <disfmarker> you know what the sell is on that . Yeah . I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working <vocalsound> Mm k . People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , True . <vocalsound> Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental <disfmarker> I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . Hmm . I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean <disfmarker> I mean that's what sets us apart Which , it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , Right . but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here Right . Yeah . and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here Right . It's either or . Yeah . and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . I think unfortunately that's our best option . It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal Mm . Of twelve fifty . 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're <vocalsound> changing the case wouldn't be so much of a <vocalsound> mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . Mm-mm . it's a major change but <disfmarker> Yeah . Gotta do what you gotta do . Alright , so Unfortunately I think we are . No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . <vocalsound> Right .
Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um <vocalsound> from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of <disfmarker> these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . Mm . Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . <vocalsound> Really good . So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . <vocalsound> So . They like that spongy feel . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Brilliant . It's <disfmarker> I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel That's everything from me .
Right . So , um , <vocalsound> this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um <vocalsound> our project process um <vocalsound> and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um <vocalsound> uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . Okay . As in within the team or ? I think so yeah . Right so Well huh . <vocalsound> An interesting day all in all I would say . <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm , I know . Mm . It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce I wanna see a <disfmarker> I Yeah . although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Um right , um so any thoughts ? Are we considering these points here ? Um . Yeah . Okay . I think they're starting blocks yeah . Well <gap> Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were <vocalsound> relatively productive , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We didn't use the whiteboard at all . <vocalsound> No , we didn't . No . No , no whiteboard . <vocalsound> We could now if that'd make up for it but really <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . Yeah Mm . Was pretty cool tack though . Yeah . Mm . Definitely . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That'd be weird . that would be kinda creepy . Attempts to contact coach ineffective <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever <disfmarker> basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . Yeah . which is always a plus . Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . <vocalsound> I think the teamwork was good as well . Mm yeah , I guess <disfmarker> <vocalsound> My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , <vocalsound> we only had four , wasn't enough . You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . I know <vocalsound> Oh well . What did you guys think about the the the roles ? Hmm . it was <disfmarker> I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . True . At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Do your own . <vocalsound> which was kind of fun . Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . Yeah . I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . That's true , Nothing , I didn't even get an email , I I got this spreadsheet <vocalsound> . Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Should . I think so . <vocalsound> So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . 'Kay but also <disfmarker> when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing <vocalsound> Mm . that wasn't very much . <vocalsound> um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was Mm . very much so . but <disfmarker> and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Yeah . That was fun . which was fine . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you Mm-hmm . Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . Very much so . Cool . And I think your leadership was quite good . It was really good yeah . Hmm . boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get <disfmarker> I I felt like I got way too into it . Yeah . Yeah . Little different . But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the <disfmarker> okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , still have 'em . everybody knows <disfmarker> best spaceships ever . Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? Yeah ? I think so . Yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't . No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't <disfmarker> I I was just <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Though we didn't actually <disfmarker> I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't <disfmarker> except for the actual building , Yeah . but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board <disfmarker> It's true huh ? well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . Yeah . I mean the whole process of <disfmarker> Wonder why <disfmarker> is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? I don't know . <vocalsound> I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , Yeah , that's it I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . Yeah . Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . True , I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . True . that's it . just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't I know , <vocalsound> I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . <vocalsound> T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what exactly we're looking for here . So is this all we need to get through ? I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . I guess . Um . New ideas . It <disfmarker> did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? Is it <disfmarker> Well , that's the thing I got <disfmarker> i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , That slide was like that ? mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all . Hmm . I guess we're on the right track . Yeah well . <vocalsound> Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? <vocalsound> W <gap> <vocalsound> I kinda like th No , none . Uh I think they still do their job . <vocalsound> Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . I think this is Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? How much time do we have left ? forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit <disfmarker> yeah <disfmarker> about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what is <disfmarker> Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work Yep . and I was like <disfmarker> had like all this brainstorming I was doing Yeah . and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway <vocalsound> Why ? You know , you know what I mean I think it was the real <gap> . like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it Yeah . so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . Yeah . Definitely when <vocalsound> when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to <disfmarker> how much I stressed over it Mm-hmm . and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . Whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I actually didn't do that at all though , Mm-hmm . every single one I <disfmarker> a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di What ? Really ? My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe Yeah , mine too . <vocalsound> Hey with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . Yeah <vocalsound> .
Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents . I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , yeah that was him . You guys ready to celebrate ? Yeah that's our last step . Celebration . Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? <vocalsound> I think so . 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . I think that's a closer . just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it <disfmarker> We got it to be . We did the project evaluation based on um <vocalsound> Sarah's evaluation of on off switches Like cutting corners . Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . and <disfmarker> is that a close ? Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . Okay , that's the end of the meeting . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Fab . what I'm gonna <disfmarker> I'm gonna put um <vocalsound> Hmm . I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <disfmarker> maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .
what I'm gonna <disfmarker> I'm gonna put um <vocalsound> Hmm . I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <disfmarker> maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .
So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells <vocalsound> um or take out the back-up battery . Uh <disfmarker> I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , <vocalsound> Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental <disfmarker> but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . It's either or . and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . I think unfortunately that's our best option . It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal
But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , <vocalsound>
um <disfmarker> obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button Mm .
Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . Yeah . I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . That's true , Nothing , I didn't even get an email , I I got this spreadsheet <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . but also <disfmarker> when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing <vocalsound> Mm . that wasn't very much . <vocalsound> um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was Mm . very much so . but <disfmarker> and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Yeah .
I think so . n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever <disfmarker> basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .
Good morning . Good morning . I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . I've prepared a little presentation . and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you <gap> on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get <disfmarker> <gap> I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan . Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras it's a a set of microphones <vocalsound> and there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them . I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . Well uh I'm uh <gap> and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think . <vocalsound> Okay , uh I'm <gap> uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh <disfmarker> look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . My name's <gap> . I'm uh <vocalsound> Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So
But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one That's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a <disfmarker> to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . <vocalsound> And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project <disfmarker> such a product . Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . Oh . As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . <vocalsound> Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this
for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . <vocalsound> because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , Okay . to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . and um try to draw <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Eraser . <vocalsound> You can try out the eraser now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Turtle . this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , Snail . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a giraffe . Make that cute . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , <vocalsound> it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So Anything else you need to know ? Could you write the words , uh underneath it ? Oh ,
Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well
And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . <gap> What's your experience with remote control ? A lot of buttons . I always lose them . Yeah . And you always lose them . <vocalsound> Yes . A lot of buttons which you don't use Yeah . Yeah . <gap> Not user friendly . <gap> search for the buttons , which one is which Mm . Black , all black . Well . Well maybe we should try to make it fun . Mm-hmm . the angle you have to use . Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . You had different remote controls for different devices . Yeah , <vocalsound> Yes , yeah . perhaps you can integrate them or something . Yes . Perhaps that's an idea . Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , Yeah , that's right . but you could uh I thin uh And which you don't use . there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection Flap just <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um <vocalsound> the usual buttons such as uh um <vocalsound> zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . Yeah , I think so , yeah . <gap> Yes . But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Mm-hmm , of course . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , <vocalsound> w <gap> So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons No . But <vocalsound> Right . Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so . But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah . Yeah . to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . Mm . Standard deliver . Yeah but I <disfmarker> but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference <disfmarker> different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , okay <gap> . Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for <disfmarker> to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh <disfmarker> No . So <gap> I think numerals . Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . Yeah , but then you have to choose the <disfmarker> always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . Yeah ,
five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . Okay . Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design .
Uh will take a look at the the working design . No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , No
And this was the Interface Designer ? Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design .
And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well
Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . Yeah , I think so , yeah . <gap> Yes . But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Mm-hmm , of course . So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons No .
Yeah but I <disfmarker> but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference <disfmarker> different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , okay <gap> . Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for <disfmarker> to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh <disfmarker> No . So <gap> I think numerals . Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . Yeah , but then you have to choose the <disfmarker> always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . Yeah ,
Okay . Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . Hm . Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than <disfmarker> you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .
and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ .
uh <vocalsound> or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh <disfmarker> can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um <vocalsound> does it do <disfmarker> or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but <disfmarker> And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . <vocalsound> Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um <vocalsound> like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . <vocalsound> That concludes my presentation . It should be <gap> yeah . Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um <vocalsound> just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> And okay so basically um <vocalsound> I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um <vocalsound> so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that <disfmarker> like close together that um <vocalsound> are used in the same way ,
Right . Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .
Um <vocalsound> we have <disfmarker> we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics ,
It's a cool idea but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Okay . So it's now like a two-part thing . Yeah , so it would be a two part package . Okay . Alright . Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the <vocalsound> thing to put the <disfmarker> you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall Yeah . or shall we leave that for now ? We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , Okay . like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . Yeah <vocalsound> . Um it seemed like a <disfmarker> a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , T You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . <vocalsound> Do <disfmarker> Let's <disfmarker> I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it <vocalsound> and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so You can hear it's under the couch yeah . So <disfmarker> Is our target group then people <disfmarker> so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that seems to <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . It's easy to implement . Okay . yeah , for sure , yeah . Locator . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . That's only for speech recognition and screen . I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,
Oh really . And uh 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . Yeah . And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . Yeah . Yeah , for sure .
or s you know , to different <disfmarker> for the iPod you press an <disfmarker> w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . Mm-hmm . B <vocalsound> Yeah . I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Yeah . I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . scrolling <disfmarker> Yeah , and it is <disfmarker> yeah . It is really <disfmarker> but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? Well can't it tell the <disfmarker> like can't you <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah and then . And then you can have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing <vocalsound> like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . Okay . so it'll be moving around . Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like <disfmarker> What do you mean the function ? but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . So <disfmarker> but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , So . Okay , let's see if I can <disfmarker> I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take <disfmarker> like just reduce the number of buttons you know , Yeah . like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . Yeah . so like you're <disfmarker> if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels ,
Um <vocalsound> let's see . <vocalsound> Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . I don't think it's the wheel dealy . Okay . See you soon . But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be <disfmarker>
Um <vocalsound> let's see . <vocalsound> Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work ,
See you soon . Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .
Is our target group then people <disfmarker> so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that seems to <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . It's easy to implement . Okay . So it's now like a two-part thing . Yeah , so it would be a two part package . Okay . Alright . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Okay . So <disfmarker>
It's a cool idea but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah .
yeah , for sure , yeah . Locator . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .
Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the <vocalsound> thing to put the <disfmarker> you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall Yeah . or shall we leave that for now ? We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other ,
I mean I guess one takes care of the other , Okay . like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . Yeah <vocalsound> .
Um it seemed like a <disfmarker> a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , T You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it <vocalsound> and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so You can hear it's under the couch yeah .
B <vocalsound> Yeah . I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Yeah .
Yeah . I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . scrolling <disfmarker> Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just <disfmarker>
First . Okay . Um , how do I put this <disfmarker> Just uh <disfmarker> Can you see ? <vocalsound> Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ? It sh it takes a few seconds I think . Yeah . and F_ eight . Could you just plug it back into hers because she had <disfmarker> Here we are . <vocalsound> The cable might be a little loose or something . Right here we are . Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? <vocalsound> Uh function F_ eight . Function F_ eight . 'Kay . What's function ? It's the little blue <disfmarker> w it's the one <disfmarker> th
So how do you switch <disfmarker> Menu . You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . and menu maybe . Oh yeah . So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next <disfmarker> Okay .
let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation . Mm 'kay , Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . I'll be the Vanna . <vocalsound> The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . Right . Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . Hmm . The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it <disfmarker> just that one button will light up . Good . Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ <vocalsound> which will actually look like our logo . <vocalsound> Great . And then on the side you have the buttons . <vocalsound> They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . yeah , the buttons . On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , it's only actually the size of my hand . Great . Great . I think you did an awesome job . Yeah , I think it's a beautiful <disfmarker>
Yeah . Yeah . Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? Are we going to indi <vocalsound> Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . Well , we've covered that with the It's just trendy , basically . trendy . It's capable of being squishy and fruity . Sure . Capable . Very capable . I'd say two as well . Yeah , two . Two . That's what I say . Uh hello , we're great . <vocalsound> Okay , fashionable ? <vocalsound> Um one . I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . Me too , very chic . <vocalsound> One , I give it a one . <vocalsound> I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . Well , that's that's just like <disfmarker> that's a clay , it's a prototype . Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . I'd give it like three or four . Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . <vocalsound> Um does it feel good ? <vocalsound> Uh the shape of it actually does uh . And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . It's gonna be curved . Right . I'd say a two . Alright , average is two . Okay . Is it technologically innovative ? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . Um yeah , I mean and it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> does it have voice <disfmarker> I mean the phrase recognition on it ? Okay , it's a PowerPoint presentation . I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . It's under evaluation . Yes . Oh right , the <disfmarker> We could do it with the chip , yes . <disfmarker> yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . Mm . Feel good meaning what ? Like does it feel good , like <disfmarker> Physically , yeah , physically . It wasn't <disfmarker> we have no reflection of it on the prototype , And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y Yeah , right . Well we don' have the <disfmarker> you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . It doesn't really count , you guys . Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . <vocalsound> And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three . Even though it is <disfmarker> for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . But it is just a T_V_ remote . Yeah .
So . Next . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions .
and we're gonna <disfmarker> <vocalsound> button supplements <disfmarker> the buttons are no They're a special colour . uh okay . Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . Are they ? And , they're a special material . yeah . Mm . Well , we're under cost then . Alright . Okay . Oh , I see . We've got eleven point two . So we can go to production . Alright . <vocalsound> No , that's it . Hmm . Oops . Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . Here we go . Alright . Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a <disfmarker> Yep . Two . Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or <disfmarker> Yeah . plastic . Plastic . And special colour . And special colour . 'Kay . Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . <vocalsound> We're really having just push-button interface . Okay ,
Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or <disfmarker> Yeah . But if it's a <disfmarker> do you wanna go for <disfmarker> this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . Oh , let's just go for a lithium . What do you say ?
I dunno what I just did . <vocalsound> Okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . There's so much available . Like it's information Yeah , digital pens . <vocalsound> I really appreciated those , yeah . were <disfmarker> Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . <vocalsound> The use of the laptops for receiving everything . It was wireless too , so .
<vocalsound> And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We got to choose <disfmarker> basically we had control over <disfmarker> minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . Right , Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> I didn't have a phone 'til university . I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . The means , the whiteboard didn't work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And no internet . Yeah . but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . Alright . Who want who would like to go first ? We think we got stifled for cri <vocalsound> creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . We didn't have a whiteboard . Hmm . Oh . Oh that's true . Hmm . And no internet . Yeah . Look at it . <vocalsound>
we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so .
we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so .
Oh , I see . We've got eleven point two . So we can go to production . Alright . And , they're a special material . yeah . Mm . Well , we're under cost then . Alright . Okay .
But if it's a <disfmarker> do you wanna go for <disfmarker> this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . Oh , let's just go for a lithium . What do you say ?
We didn't have a whiteboard . Alright . Who want who would like to go first ?

The means , the whiteboard didn't work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And no internet . Yeah . Oh that's true . Hmm . And no internet . Yeah .
Hello everybody . Hi , good morning . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um <vocalsound> we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh <disfmarker> people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design ,
and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 'Kay .
'Kay . Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> that's the worst yet , that's <disfmarker> it's meant to be an eagle <vocalsound> A seagu Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . Mm . There you go . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? A kind of dog ? <vocalsound> I think it's outstandingly good . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be <vocalsound> because that looks like a beak now , so . <vocalsound> Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Crocodile ?
um production cost's at twelve fifty , so Okay , Mm . Mm-hmm . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So then <disfmarker> You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a <disfmarker> um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups Mm-hmm . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? It's about <disfmarker> Seventeen . mm , mm yeah . yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . Seventeen Pounds . Seventeen . Okay , that's expensive . Should we be making notes of this ? Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those <disfmarker> the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . So , it'd still be <disfmarker>
Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm . Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got <disfmarker> we got um <disfmarker> we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up Mm-hmm . Yeah . so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , Alright . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control Yeah , that c but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . so that might have had something to do with it , uh . but that was quite good , the fact that you could <disfmarker> You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . Use all the ones at the same time . Okay . 'cause you <disfmarker> My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . so that when you flip over the top , your screen is <disfmarker> you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . <disfmarker> and you don't want to <disfmarker> I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do Mm . Yeah . Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , Yeah . symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . <vocalsound> Um . So simplification of symbols you could think of . When they're <disfmarker> when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . Oh yeah .
But I don't know how <disfmarker> I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost <vocalsound> in the phone , and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , <vocalsound> Yeah . you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Mm-hmm . Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , Mm-hmm . Menu , alright . I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , Yeah . so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . Uh uh <disfmarker> Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . Yeah . What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , Yeah . that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , Mm , yeah , the age gap .
But it might have its cost implications . Okay . And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Mm . Right . Something that's easily moulded and produced . Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um <vocalsound> Sure . about what you're saying about the uh <disfmarker> does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of <disfmarker> I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh <disfmarker> we put the fashion into electronics , Ah right . Okay . Sure b I mean you don't <disfmarker> you you can still have plastic y yeah . th that was my main point , Yeah . we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I would <disfmarker> it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , Right . so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . Okay .
and then we'll come back and liaise again Yeah . and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . <vocalsound> Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it
Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is <disfmarker> you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . Mm-hmm . Mm , okay . I think that's a cost thing , S and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , <vocalsound> Yeah . you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Mm-hmm .
Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . <vocalsound> The meeting will be forty minutes long . Okay .
The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . <vocalsound> Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . <vocalsound> Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . Yeah . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . Mm . Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . <vocalsound> There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . Um <disfmarker> Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . Right . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . um , the <disfmarker> we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Yeah . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some <disfmarker> we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , <disfmarker> they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . Mm-hmm . Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we would have to have an L_C_D_ um Yeah . That's true . display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . And that would lead to an advanced <disfmarker> And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Mm-hmm . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . Right . <vocalsound> My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Yeah . <vocalsound> Sounds brilliant to me . Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Uh . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , <vocalsound> Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way . Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . W So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top Or like an <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just <disfmarker> it's protective as well . It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . Yeah .
I <disfmarker> Hmm ? No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per That's um <disfmarker> Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or <vocalsound> by the human user . And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . Oh . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . I'm not really sure about the pictures that <disfmarker> maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Mm . Yeah . Mm . So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . <vocalsound>
Yeah . But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . Yeah . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . Yeah , we'll be doing <disfmarker> It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . Yeah . Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , Yeah .
Mm . I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? Mm-hmm . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . Yeah . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . <vocalsound> And that all interfaces are different . and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . But um <disfmarker> But what about the lighting up effect ? You mean different colours for the lighting or <disfmarker> Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would <disfmarker> if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . Oh . Where would the light come from ? Okay . I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . Right . Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , Yeah , yeah .
Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . <vocalsound> So , pretty basic there . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . Um <disfmarker> So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as <disfmarker> we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . <vocalsound>
Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Mm-hmm . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's , it's a little <gap> but it , it's everywhere . Yeah . I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Yeah . One thing I was thinking though is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . Yeah . <vocalsound> So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog . Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Kinetic yeah . no . So <disfmarker> I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points . Go for it . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? Yeah . I don Uh , so that's the simple . Mm-hmm . yeah . Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? Yeah possibly . So it's a medium . Okay . So regular chip . That's called medium , or regular ? Regular chip . Oh , is regular not simple ? Yeah . Yeah if we <disfmarker> It's for the lighting , yeah . because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . Right right right . Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Rubber . Still going for that . yeah , interchangeable plates . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright , and supplements . What's that all about ? Um , well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the <disfmarker> in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? We haven't really decided what to do about that . Um , what are our choices here ? So pretty <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> just just the basic button functions . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume , changes like that . let's do this fast . Um <disfmarker> Well that didn't some up on mine . Should we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually . Yeah , I don't , I <disfmarker> it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we <disfmarker> I guess that it affects the marketing , I've <disfmarker> 'cause it , <vocalsound> mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . Yeah . That could be a sales pitch . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah .
brilliant . Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . Mm-hmm . Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . Okay .
We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes .
Mm-hmm . Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product .
Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . <vocalsound> And you'll be evaluating the product .
Um , Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . Okay .
Yeah . But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . Yeah .
Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . Mm-hmm . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . and well rubber is a more translucent product too , Yeah , yeah . so we have that taken care of . Mm-hmm .
Still going for that . yeah , interchangeable plates . Yeah . So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as <disfmarker> we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us .
Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Kinetic yeah .
So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? Yeah .
Okay . So regular chip . That's called medium , or regular ? So it's a medium .
Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Rubber . Yeah . Yeah . So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . And then <disfmarker>
just just the basic button functions . Yeah . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume , changes like that . That could be a sales pitch . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah . So pretty <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker>
Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Mm-hmm . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's , it's a little <gap> but it , it's everywhere . Yeah . um of course , as <disfmarker> we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Yeah .
let's do this fast . Um <disfmarker> Well that didn't some up on mine . Should we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually . Yeah , I don't , I <disfmarker> it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we <disfmarker>
I guess that it affects the marketing , I've <disfmarker> 'cause it , <vocalsound> mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . Yeah . That could be a sales pitch . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah .
Okay . So welcome back . <vocalsound> <gap> . So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your <disfmarker> in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then <vocalsound>
We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So <disfmarker> That's my task . Okay . <vocalsound> So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> I don't get it . <vocalsound> Make it . I think it will be a few minutes and <disfmarker> Okay . First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it <disfmarker> uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , <vocalsound> um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now <gap> <disfmarker> And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all <vocalsound> we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh <disfmarker> it won't be uh <disfmarker> We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a <gap> <disfmarker> menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's <disfmarker> I think it's easier . Mm-hmm . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when <disfmarker> what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Okay so it's the size of the remote control . <gap> Just <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've <disfmarker> you need the television , wh which can use it . Yeah . But uh I think this <disfmarker> our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Okay . Or is it also for other company <disfmarker> uh for other televisions ? I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . Then this is an option . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . Yeah but I don't <disfmarker> I think it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . Mm . Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .
Okay . And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But <disfmarker> Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . Hmm . And also different things . Yeah . Good idea . Will this will this add to the cost ? Yes . Uh then it won't be <disfmarker> uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . Mm-hmm . Not much . 'Kay . Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . Just one . Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . <vocalsound> If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? Uh a p a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think <disfmarker> When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Maybe . Would you change the cover ? I wi I won't . But maybe I think trendy people No . or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh <disfmarker> N yeah but <disfmarker> I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah it's a good idea . But <disfmarker> If if it <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't <disfmarker> I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh <disfmarker> Okay . <gap> But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . <vocalsound> Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . No .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh <disfmarker> for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh <disfmarker> and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh <disfmarker> We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . <vocalsound> Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? We'll got back on that later . Okay yeah . Yeah well the <disfmarker> that was just on my mind . Yes . So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk <vocalsound> . Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .
'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . Okay . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I <vocalsound> I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the <gap> we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say <gap> . I will <disfmarker> that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change <vocalsound> I think . <vocalsound> And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two <disfmarker> several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh <disfmarker> also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . Mm-hmm . Um well th uh that's my second point . <vocalsound> Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um <disfmarker> You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly ,
Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . No . Do you think ? No . And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . Like <disfmarker> No . No . So it's <disfmarker> Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . Uh-huh . I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . Mm-hmm . What d d d um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Uh we go <gap> <disfmarker> back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . Yeah . I have uh one question . If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . Yes . Yes . Mm-hmm .
Um <disfmarker> Uh we go <gap> <disfmarker> back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . <vocalsound> So not necessary . Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . <vocalsound> Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . <vocalsound> maybe we should first have a discussion about that . Yes , it's okay . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . Yeah but we don't use it . It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> new requirement . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay sorry . No discussion about it . Then uh <disfmarker>
And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the <disfmarker> then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So Yes . But then we come to the costs . we need <disfmarker> But if we have this <disfmarker> 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? Mute . Mute . Maybe in the menu ? So <vocalsound> like you said , we need the <disfmarker> <gap> . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . Sorry ? what controls do we need ? Who first ? Well a power button ? <vocalsound> Okay . Uh power . Uh the well um I think separate channels . So <disfmarker> Uh mm channel . But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . Channel <disfmarker> Zero to nine . Uh volume . Volume . Zero to nine . To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . Yeah that's the channel . D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . <vocalsound> <gap> I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . Yes . And uh a menu uh button .
And <disfmarker> I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to <disfmarker> But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or <disfmarker> Yes . No that's for the next phase . Okay . Um <gap> <disfmarker> Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . This will be the buttons .
And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .
And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . Is this enough ? Mute . Mute . Maybe in the menu ? Okay . Uh power . Uh the well um I think separate channels . So <disfmarker> Uh mm channel . But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . Channel <disfmarker> Zero to nine . Uh volume . Volume . Zero to nine . To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . Yeah that's the channel . D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . <vocalsound> <gap> I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . Yes . And uh a menu uh button .
.. . Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . I didn't receive it yet <vocalsound> . Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to <disfmarker> so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Mm-hmm . Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss <disfmarker> come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .
The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . <gap> not at this point . So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going <disfmarker> the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together . I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? I think it <disfmarker> th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be <disfmarker> we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do Right . but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that <gap> and includes the <disfmarker> how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . How how it will be done . Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the <disfmarker> it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then Okay .
Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert <vocalsound> um so like I'm gonna be doing the <disfmarker> apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything <disfmarker> the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm Jen . So yeah , I like cows . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it Yeah . to match the rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I like the cow . <vocalsound> Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um <vocalsound> familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for <vocalsound> for the project , specifically the whiteboard . Hmm . So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . It's a gecko . Ah , a gecko , okay . we've got plenty of time . So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey That's where I'm from , Australia . I'm from Melbourne Okay , what do <gap> it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , right , my roles , <gap> . um so um in the different um <vocalsound> stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for <vocalsound> yeah , designing the technical functions of the um <vocalsound> um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going Mm . and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . Wonderful . and let the drawing stay . <vocalsound> 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um <vocalsound>
okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have <disfmarker> w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that <vocalsound> are out of the ordinary . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was <disfmarker> that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . Something something new . Mm . <vocalsound> Uh we can aim for <disfmarker> I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got <disfmarker> let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing .
and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? Mm-hmm . So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . Uh-huh . Mm . Okay . So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . But what do most people do ? They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , Sometimes they play a movie . maybe to do <disfmarker> Yep . It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , Hmm . because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . with l <vocalsound> learning , yeah , yeah .
but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um <vocalsound> we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're <disfmarker> you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , Thanks for that . Thank you . Uh I'll see you in half an hour . <vocalsound> .
and for you it's the user requirements specification , Mm-hmm . you're looking at the technical functions design ,
you're <disfmarker> you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , <vocalsound> Alright .
and for you it's the user requirements specification , but im basically you're looking at the working design , <vocalsound> Alright . you're looking at the technical functions design ,
so you're <disfmarker> you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,
that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . let's make that go away ,
that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .

Mm . Okay . So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? Yep . It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . Yeah . and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? Mm-hmm . So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . Uh-huh . maybe to do <disfmarker>
Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , Hmm . because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . with l <vocalsound> learning , yeah , yeah .
so that we can go away and get on with some of this . but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now ,
<vocalsound> Right well . Welcome to the <disfmarker> what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here Um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um
if we just lengthen it I guess <vocalsound> Yeah So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda <disfmarker> so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . <vocalsound> Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . Uh-huh . Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g yeah , good , good . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that Uh-huh . Yep , right . Um the logo is down down there um Uh-huh . Mm . S and <gap> has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes <disfmarker> the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything Yep , and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . yep , <vocalsound> The final product would actually stand up , yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah , yeah , yeah , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on <gap> . Yeah , so it comes down to the base of the hand just kind of <disfmarker> for the more natural kinda <disfmarker> <gap> . Right . Okay <gap> for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the <disfmarker> broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger Yeah ,
yep , mm-hmm . And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light <vocalsound> non-descript grey Mm . so that people'll wanna buy the covers Yep . and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . <gap> showing me age , Yeah . you know spongy like is something that people wanted Okay , yep , right . and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well Mm-hmm . But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers and <disfmarker> Yeah . good yeah . and then the buttons come through Yeah . and so <disfmarker> and then the <disfmarker> each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . Yep , right .
What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I <gap> get the uh spreadsheet up . Oh . Now I've um <vocalsound> this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're <vocalsound> we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole <gap> the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um <vocalsound> slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway
and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . Okay , uh . So um . I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at <disfmarker> exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um <vocalsound> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers Mm . so uh um you know the <disfmarker> if if if the management expect us to be techno <gap> again <gap> fail again <disfmarker> technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , Mm .
Does anybody want to uh <disfmarker> uh Andrew do you want <disfmarker> what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation Evaluation . <vocalsound> Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . <vocalsound> There we go , oh . Method of evaluation <vocalsound> testing the product was to just <gap> if it met all the criteria <disfmarker> all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard <vocalsound> um gauge our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . <vocalsound> Seven being a nice round number to work to . <vocalsound> Yeah . And then at the end just take an average Tr <vocalsound> So uh . <vocalsound> So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? Well I think most definitely . Yeah I think it is yeah . I'd say definitely a one yeah . So uh <disfmarker> and also uh technologically innovative ? Yes Yeah , defi yeah , yeah the voice technology indeed . Yeah . Easy to use ? I don't see we could've made it any easier . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Totally . Yeah definitely . Yeah I think it made <disfmarker> we met all of the consumer Yeah . Yeah . wants . Uh is it complicated ? No . No . Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? <vocalsound> Uh functional ? Yeah . Yeah definitely . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> Where are we ? <gap> found easily . We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . <gap> yeah Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't . No , not at all . Mm-hmm . And uh , what else ? <vocalsound> The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , <vocalsound> Less buttons well . we made an actual effort to <disfmarker> <gap> it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . Yeah . <gap> yeah . So yeah , um um . <vocalsound> Um will device appeal to all age groups ? I think it will Mm . because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so <disfmarker> I think so . yeah . Well we had the we had the data <gap> saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , <vocalsound> the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . Mm . well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so <disfmarker> I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups Mm . Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , <vocalsound> Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's <disfmarker> <gap> in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is t it's television only , Yep . it's it's simple to use , Mm-hmm . um it's it's it's within budget , Under the cost . Um . So uh I I think we've done an amazing job Yep . <vocalsound> coming up with what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by <vocalsound> eleven's one so <vocalsound> equals average of one . I don't think so , I mean No . I think we worked well together
<vocalsound> So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by <vocalsound> eleven's one so <vocalsound> equals average of one . Yeah , <vocalsound> .
<vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> I mean No . I think we worked well together <gap> . and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make Yeah . Yeah . and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , Mm . Yeah , definitely . I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Yeah . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh <disfmarker> I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Mm-hmm . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself Mm . and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh Yeah . Yep . uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um Yep .
We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um Yep . Thank you very much indeed , Cool , thank you <vocalsound> , I think that <disfmarker> I think that's uh <vocalsound> So I call the meeting closed . Okay .
yep , mm-hmm . And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light <vocalsound> non-descript grey Mm .
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . <gap> showing me age , so that people'll wanna buy the covers Yep .
yeah , good , good . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda <disfmarker> so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . <vocalsound> Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . Uh-huh . Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section
but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets .
and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . Okay , uh . So um . I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at <disfmarker> exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um <vocalsound> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers Mm . so uh um you know the <disfmarker> if if if the management expect us to be techno <gap> again <gap> fail again <disfmarker> technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , Mm .
Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . Um I did <disfmarker> took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's <disfmarker> I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ? and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . <vocalsound> Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . And go to that one . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early Uh I think so , Did I miss something ? we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . Mm-hmm . but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've <disfmarker> are <disfmarker> they're accepting the minutes . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I do . Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . Okay ?
Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar <disfmarker> of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players <disfmarker> although it makes immediate sense to <vocalsound> have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh <disfmarker> will only benefit from the positive feedback <vocalsound> from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um <vocalsound> fifty percent <disfmarker> I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this <vocalsound> there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . Could <disfmarker> can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've <disfmarker> Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . Now Mm . So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires <vocalsound> looked into your your uh concern about technology <vocalsound> Hmm . and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . Okay . Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them <vocalsound> would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if <disfmarker> and you know , the the designers , Mm . but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five <disfmarker> Is that a large enough target market to target it ? Well , I I I think <disfmarker> especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh <disfmarker> In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? <vocalsound> Yeah . that's a that's a very good question . <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , Um <disfmarker> but I think it's an interesting <disfmarker> Mm . I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research Mm . Shall I go back ? on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , Yeah , yeah . and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . Yeah . How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , Kate , you're exactly right there . <vocalsound> But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be <disfmarker>
Uh , mm . that's looking at age groups . Exactly . I <vocalsound> yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar <disfmarker> younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable , Leap . <vocalsound> Okay , you had the other power channel . I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . <vocalsound> And this is this is also supported by the market research . But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen ,
I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access <disfmarker> it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . Mm . Okay . o I was thinking something <disfmarker> some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . Alright . Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . Okay . No . Okay . But we could go back to the pictures of the <disfmarker> uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , Or if <disfmarker> Hmm . Whiteboard session . I think the white <disfmarker> that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . <vocalsound> The the style of these is terrible . Yeah . <vocalsound> I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . <vocalsound> The ergonomics , the way it fits in your <disfmarker> <gap> So that's that for now . Cheers . that one , yep . Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . Okay . Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . T_V_ only . So these are two models of existing remote controls . Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . <vocalsound> Ugh . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has <disfmarker> seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control Hmm . where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has <disfmarker> it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all .
and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need <disfmarker> gonna need to hit . Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? Whoop . the chip composer sender . Mm . What they cost . Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna <vocalsound> give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , I I don't believe I know , um . It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , Mm-hmm . Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . <vocalsound> Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , <vocalsound> and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . <vocalsound> And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and <disfmarker> which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the <disfmarker> which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . <vocalsound> So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be . Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Hmm-mm . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . <vocalsound> Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of <disfmarker> what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . Mm-hmm . The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um <disfmarker> because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em , Mm . um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just <disfmarker> if it goes wrong you chuck it out ,
Mm . but basically just the same . Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . You could <disfmarker> you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , Well that has another element , which are <disfmarker> which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you <disfmarker> then it has a place . Mm . but it also has a place , so <disfmarker> And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . exactly . Mm . <vocalsound> But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . <vocalsound> That's a really good idea . Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . <vocalsound> I'll do some research for the next meeting . Well Okay . it's better than my idea about solar , probably . <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . it is just so annoying how <disfmarker> It would have to sor store up the energy Mm . Yeah . We may be talking quite heavy then . Yeah . M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . Mm-hmm . No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably <disfmarker> I mean it might cost more to <disfmarker> at first to develop and to install , Mm-hmm but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer Mm-hmm . So you know f do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? Definitely , Mm . Mm . Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . <vocalsound> So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is <disfmarker> And the dock could look very fancy Exactly . and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . Mm .
Yeah , exactly . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment . are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , Yeah . <vocalsound> It might be good to know I don't know . Yeah . um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? Yeah . Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , good point . Yeah . That's probably more what it is . What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? <vocalsound> We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ? <vocalsound> Probably not . Mm . Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n <vocalsound> definitely we wanna be inspired that the current <vocalsound> styles are just plain awful . Yeah . Okay , I I <disfmarker> my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only <disfmarker> just really in terms of streamlining . Ah . Okay . Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was miles away . Would that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> H how does that work ? <vocalsound> Um well How <disfmarker> so so how does that work , uh-huh . how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um <disfmarker> so you press power after you've Then you'd have to have an off te off key . um <disfmarker> well I was thinking maybe you <disfmarker> to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , Okay , yep , mm-hmm . and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . Mm . It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this , yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Who's got an iPod then ? <vocalsound> Anyway , uh <vocalsound> that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . It's definitely channel , volume , power . Mm . Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , Exactly . like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . Exactly . Mm-hmm . We don't wanna outsmart <disfmarker> As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . <vocalsound> I just joined that set last week . Okay ? Okay . We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down Alright , well that's fine then . Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . Okay . Um and you'd mentioned <disfmarker> I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it <disfmarker> they were <disfmarker> it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself <disfmarker> Um the teletext is outdated , So the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um Okay . what what actually are these <disfmarker> is that the yellow and black ? It doesn't tell me . Mm . From their <disfmarker> I'll just use it from their website . Mm-hmm . Mm . Okay . Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . Well I I brought up some <disfmarker> exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? Mm .
um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface
and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .
Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . Um and each of us will get help from our coach .
in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be Mm-hmm . um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important ,
um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_
um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . Mm-hmm . and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_
Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . Well
Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .
Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .
Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n <vocalsound> definitely we wanna be inspired Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .
Yeah , exactly . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh <disfmarker> In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Oh oh oh the chip composer sender . Mm . What they cost . Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna <vocalsound> give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , I I don't believe I know , um . I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment . are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? Mm .
I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need <disfmarker> gonna need to hit . Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? Whoop .
Okay . it's better than my idea about solar , probably . <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . it is just so annoying how <disfmarker> It would have to sor store up the energy Mm . Yeah . We may be talking quite heavy then . Yeah . M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . Mm-hmm . Well
that has another element , which are <disfmarker> which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you <disfmarker> then it has a place . Mm . exactly . Mm . <vocalsound> But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . <vocalsound> That's a really good idea . Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . <vocalsound> I'll do some research for the next meeting . Mm-hmm . No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably <disfmarker> I mean it might cost more to <disfmarker> at first to develop and to install , Mm-hmm but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer Mm-hmm . So you know f do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? Definitely , and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . Mm .
Yeah , exactly . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment . are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? Mm .
Okay , I I <disfmarker> my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only <disfmarker> just really in terms of streamlining . Ah . Okay . Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was miles away . Would that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> H how does that work ? <vocalsound> Um well How <disfmarker> so so how does that work , uh-huh . how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um <disfmarker> so you press power after you've Then you'd have to have an off te off key . um <disfmarker> well I was thinking maybe you <disfmarker> to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , Okay , yep , mm-hmm . and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . Mm . It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this ,
Okay , carry on . <vocalsound> Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have <disfmarker> the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . <vocalsound> um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay . <vocalsound> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . Right um the meeting <disfmarker> the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of <disfmarker> going after <disfmarker> going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for <disfmarker> be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um <vocalsound> the corporate image . So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . <vocalsound> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <vocalsound> fruit <vocalsound> fruit themed sleeves . <vocalsound> Don't you ? <vocalsound> Yes . It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . Exactly . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . <gap> you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . Mm . They could be <disfmarker> ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually <disfmarker> the sleeve could <vocalsound> take up a lot of the <vocalsound> development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it <disfmarker> we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the <disfmarker> someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . Mm . you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <vocalsound> spongy fruit and veg . Yeah , Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Right . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . Mm 'kay . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um <vocalsound> more vibrant things . <vocalsound> So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh <disfmarker> the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . <vocalsound> so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg . Spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is really interesting change from past years , <vocalsound> because it is much more organic , Mm . um some would say approachable . <vocalsound> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . So . <vocalsound> I also did a little research on um <vocalsound> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <vocalsound> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically <vocalsound> superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three ,
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <vocalsound> fruit <vocalsound> fruit themed sleeves . <vocalsound> Don't you ? <vocalsound> Yes . It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . Exactly . <vocalsound> Exactly .

Mm . They could be <disfmarker> ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually <disfmarker> the sleeve could <vocalsound> take up a lot of the <vocalsound> development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own .

Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three ,
Yeah , Thanks . I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . <vocalsound> Alright . Yep . Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . Hmm . <vocalsound> And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . Hmm . <vocalsound> Is this <gap> to the market <gap> ? Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , Is spongiest , yeah . yeah . That would add <disfmarker> I was thinking titanium myself . I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just <disfmarker> I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , Mm-hmm . and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? <vocalsound> Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So <disfmarker> Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management Yeah , And then we could keep it titanium . Yeah . <vocalsound> W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um <disfmarker> maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . Okay , yeah . Scratch and sniff . <vocalsound> Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . <vocalsound> Right , well
I I I think some of this um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . <vocalsound> So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something This is this is the a a <vocalsound> a remote that's been opened up Mm . and that's the the back of the interface . And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um <vocalsound> and we <disfmarker> that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . So um but um <vocalsound> doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . We can have a hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A wind-up . sorry <disfmarker> a wind-up , yeah , <vocalsound> which I think is quite an interesting concept for a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> sorry <disfmarker> for a remote control , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but i it maybe is <disfmarker> doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , Alright . Remember , we only have forty minutes where um <vocalsound> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , Mm . it'll work . Hmm . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . Mm . Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , <vocalsound> or titanium . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um <vocalsound> I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , Hmm . and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . Hmm . Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <vocalsound> Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , Hmm . so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . <vocalsound> Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it <disfmarker> the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it <disfmarker> that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Mm . And <disfmarker> well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which <vocalsound> means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that <vocalsound> may or may not be a good thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <vocalsound> So , Any idea <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could <disfmarker> if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um manufacturing didn't actually give <disfmarker> attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . Hmm . Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . <vocalsound> Banana ? let's see then . But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . Yeah . It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . Yeah . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . But <disfmarker> yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , Yeah .
Mm-hmm . I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . <vocalsound> Um . But as for actually arranging them <disfmarker> let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . Mm-hmm . Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Right . so you pick your menu and then <disfmarker> your different options and when when you click on each one , it <disfmarker> you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here . Really we'd have to use something to show you , Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design , but <disfmarker> Wow . Them , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh <disfmarker> It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , It's a selection wheel . which I think is a really good idea . But we can implement it with simple push buttons , Yeah , Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , <vocalsound> uh and then also <vocalsound> when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . Okay . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . Okay . Might take up your whole living room . <vocalsound> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the <disfmarker> something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . You know , we could call <vocalsound> like a fruit name , Possibly . Hmm . but it would be a little more abstract . Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather <disfmarker> if you feel <disfmarker> if you like the spongy <disfmarker> That also is possible . Hmm . Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down , but <vocalsound> they both say V_ on them , Mm-hmm . so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . Yeah . Hmm . Nice . Good point . But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . Mm 'kay . This time it should come up both . <vocalsound> Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , Okay . just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . <vocalsound> Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which <disfmarker> the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . Hmm . So I was thinking that uh <vocalsound> um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um Hmm . and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do <disfmarker> you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up <vocalsound> and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , Mm . um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So <vocalsound> what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , <vocalsound> just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . Yeah . Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . <vocalsound> Hmm . Uh <vocalsound> then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um <vocalsound> otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting <disfmarker> building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well .
but it is hugely complicated . Mm . What else have we got ? because it is much more organic , Mm . um some would say approachable . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So <vocalsound> let's <disfmarker> Mm . Right . They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which <disfmarker> the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , The <disfmarker> You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Mm . Exactly . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . <gap> you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . Mm . They could be <disfmarker> ini unfortunately I don't have costing information . Okay . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry Mm 'kay . I don't figures on the difference in cost . What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? I've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice um that it's there . and it's very very uh handy , It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . Hmm . we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the <disfmarker> someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . Mm . <vocalsound> So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . yeah , a good selling point . So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . Be But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . It costs . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . And and how much you do have to keep it moving , Mm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a <vocalsound> a <disfmarker> I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . Mm . <vocalsound> Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . <vocalsound> Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . <vocalsound> Oh right , okay , Um <vocalsound> the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . I'd <disfmarker> Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique Oh . um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , Oh because I'm not sure I have an alternative . and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . Oh , okay . Um what about the case ? I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , <vocalsound> and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ? yeah . What about you ? Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , Mm . Kind of like an internal egg . Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh <disfmarker> sounds like a nice idea if it is . Yeah . and <disfmarker> You know . <vocalsound> Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I su I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to <vocalsound> finish with . Then I'll just say I support either <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . Okay , Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that Yeah , I'd <disfmarker> like push buttons with <disfmarker> that brings the cost down quite a lot yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Mm . Right . This is this is the a a <vocalsound> a remote that's been opened up Mm . and that's the the back of the interface . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , Mm . uh Steph gets the user interface design , where um <vocalsound> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , Mm . which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . Mm . Now Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . <vocalsound> Mm . And <disfmarker> well Yeah . Mm . Yep . Thank you , Kate . Thank you , Kate . Mm . You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , Mm . um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , Mm . it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .
Mm . uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product <vocalsound> evaluation . Um the two of you <vocalsound> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . No ,
these are <vocalsound> the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , Mm . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can .
Um the look and feel design is for Kate , Mm . uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product <vocalsound> evaluation . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can .
Great . uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product <vocalsound> evaluation . Um the two of you <vocalsound> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .
So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . Be yeah , a good selling point .
What about you ? Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , Mm . yeah .
What about you ? Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , Mm . yeah .
Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that Yeah , I'd <disfmarker> like push buttons with <disfmarker> that brings the cost down quite a lot
Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , Is spongiest , yeah . yeah . That would add <disfmarker> I was thinking titanium myself . I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just <disfmarker> I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , Mm-hmm . and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . but it would be a little more abstract . Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather <disfmarker> if you feel <disfmarker> if you like the spongy <disfmarker> That also is possible . And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . Yeah .
Any idea <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could <disfmarker> if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um manufacturing didn't actually give <disfmarker> attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . Hmm .
but it is hugely complicated . Mm . What else have we got ? because it is much more organic , Mm . um some would say approachable . The <disfmarker> You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Mm . Exactly . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . <gap> you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . Mm . They could be <disfmarker> ini unfortunately I don't have costing information . Okay . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry Mm 'kay . I don't figures on the difference in cost . What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . Hmm . you don't even notice um that it's there . It sounds great . we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the <disfmarker> someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . Mm . <vocalsound> So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . yeah , a good selling point . So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . Be But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . It costs . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . And and how much you do have to keep it moving , Mm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a <vocalsound> a <disfmarker> I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . Mm . <vocalsound> Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . <vocalsound> Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? What about you ? Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , Mm . Kind of like an internal egg . yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Mm . Right . This is this is the a a <vocalsound> a remote that's been opened up Mm . and that's the the back of the interface . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , Mm . uh Steph gets the user interface design , where um <vocalsound> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , Mm . which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . Mm . Now Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . <vocalsound> Mm . And <disfmarker> well Yeah . Mm . Yep . Thank you , Kate . Thank you , Kate . Mm . You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , Mm . um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , Mm . it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .
Okay Right <vocalsound> Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . Um <vocalsound> and um But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . Yep . M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Great . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so we're designing a new remote control and um <disfmarker> Oh I have to record who's here actually . And you all arrived on time . Um yeah so des uh <vocalsound> design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . <vocalsound> So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ? Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal is like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A beagle . <vocalsound> charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . Lovely . <vocalsound> <gap> Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , <vocalsound> I'm gonna be up there with them . so um fish was a natural choice . Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go <vocalsound> eat everything in sight . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the <disfmarker> thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . Uh-huh . Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um . No . <vocalsound> Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 'Kay . So cost <disfmarker> like production cost is twelve fifty , All together . but selling price is <disfmarker> is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf . That's a good question . Our sale our sale anyway . I imagine it probably is our sale actually Yeah , okay okay . because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . Okay . But I <disfmarker> I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? Yes . <vocalsound>
Yeah . but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . Still feels quite primitive . Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S Maybe like a touch screen or something ? Something like that , yeah . Okay . Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . Uh-huh , okay . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . Mm-hmm . Okay so <disfmarker> Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <disfmarker> Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , I think so . do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , Mm-hmm . everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , Okay . so um , you know <disfmarker> I think one factor would be production cost . Okay , yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Hmm . Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Oh yeah , Oh that's a good idea . regions and stuff , yeah . An um as well as uh characters , Okay . um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . Hmm . So extra functionalities . Yeah . Um I guess that's up to us , Yeah , sure . It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . Yeah , yeah . And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so <disfmarker> What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? Yeah . Yeah . W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . Yeah . Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , Mm . thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,
Yep . the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it
so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about ,
I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually <disfmarker> what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .
Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . Uh-huh . Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? <vocalsound> Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro .
But I <disfmarker> I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? Yes . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Hmm . Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Oh yeah ,
Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 'Kay . um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro .
so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh that's a good idea . An So extra functionalities . Yeah . Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? Th Okay so <disfmarker> Right ,
Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . <vocalsound> Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . <vocalsound> Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how ,
but <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . Very nice . And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , And um <vocalsound> that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ? That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . <gap> use both . Might as well think about <disfmarker> T the actual thing might be smaller . Th think about the button as well . not do it at all . Just the on and off . It's a quick on-off button . Uh , 'kay .
<vocalsound> Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . <gap> . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . <vocalsound> I dunno . Just , I'm sure there's a <gap> . Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? Two . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ? Uh <disfmarker> Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ? It's very intuitive , I think yeah . 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? Uh yeah . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints . <vocalsound> Okay . Um spongy material ? Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . did we put the fashion in electronics ?
Yep , not angular . Mm . I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . <vocalsound> Five ? four . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Four is fair . That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . Mm . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . That's true . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . Mm . Yeah .
With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . Yeah . Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . Yeah . where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . Yeah . So . Are we adding one of these two features ? Let's add one of those features and say yes . <vocalsound> <gap> gonna say <disfmarker> So we're <vocalsound> back to a one ? Or a two ? Two . Two . Two , 'kay . Two . Okay . the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ? It's very intuitive , I think yeah . Yeah . I'd say that <disfmarker> 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls <gap> most common , which are channel and volume . Right . Right . So one ? So that's a one . Yeah ? <vocalsound> Probably some e either two or four . Two . Two ? How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints . Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . <vocalsound> Yeah . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .
Y yes . I'd say we did . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , On the <disfmarker> It's all just <disfmarker> screens on . It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it's stolen technology . <gap> 'cause it's stolen . I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <vocalsound> No maybe not . <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> Um I would say we're probably at four . Really ? Um spongy material ? Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . We have some spongy , yeah . Yeah as much as as needed , I think . 'Kay . It's not a one though . No . So that's a four at most . Probably a four at most . And lastly ,
Special colour ? That's not a special colour . Bright yellow . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . <vocalsound> <gap> remote control <gap> . Uh just <disfmarker> Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . No Well , let's see . <vocalsound> Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . So we're <vocalsound> back to a one ? Or a two ? Two . Two . Two , 'kay . Two . Okay . Yeah . We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well . Okay so <disfmarker> Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? <vocalsound> Probably some e either two or four . Two . Two ? That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 'Kay , <gap> we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a <disfmarker> Probably it's double curved . Double curved , yes . Case materials are Plastic . plastic .
So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? Right . We may not need it . There you go . Yeah . Yeah . So s yeah let's take away the <disfmarker> Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is Yeah that's too much . by three Euros over . It's hard to believe . Uh that is possible yeah .
I guess that <disfmarker> Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts . <vocalsound> Trying to fill in some time there . <vocalsound> Uh h what did you think of our project process ? I think we did <disfmarker> Great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> yeah I think we did quite well . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . <gap> we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . Yeah . We've used the whiteboard . Super super . I had some problem with the pen I think , Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . but <vocalsound> minus your p
So . Are we adding one of these two features ? Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . Yeah . Let's add one of those features and say yes . <vocalsound> <gap> gonna say <disfmarker>
Two . Two . Two , 'kay . Two . Okay . Probably some e either two or four . Two . Two ? So we're <vocalsound> back to a one ? Or a two ?
That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 'Kay ,
'Kay then the case is a <disfmarker> Probably it's double curved . Double curved , yes . 'Kay , <gap> we have one of those .
'Kay then the case is a <disfmarker> Probably it's double curved . Double curved , yes . Case materials are Plastic . plastic .
Special colour ? That's not a special colour . Bright yellow . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . <vocalsound>
So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? Uh that is possible yeah . Right . We may not need it . There you go .
So . Are we adding one of these two features ? where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . Yeah . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . Yeah . Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . Yeah . Let's add one of those features and say yes . <vocalsound> <gap> gonna say <disfmarker>
<gap> remote control <gap> . Uh just <disfmarker> Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . No
What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . <vocalsound> And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . Yeah Yeah . Yeah . So s yeah let's take away the <disfmarker> Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is Yeah that's too much . by three Euros over . It's hard to believe .
So <disfmarker> Let's see . First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh <disfmarker> if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , My name's Frank . hello . Hello . Thank you . Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off .
Let's do it read only . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart <gap> the project manager Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yep . Visit it . Yep . Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound> Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh <disfmarker> there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Oh yeah .
I'm Bart <gap> the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . This is our agenda . <vocalsound> Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . <vocalsound> Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or <disfmarker> Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . Sure . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Um okay , what are we going to do ? <vocalsound> Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . <vocalsound> He's also uh <disfmarker> That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . <vocalsound> I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . <vocalsound> And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project <disfmarker> uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . <vocalsound>
so <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yep . Visit it . Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? <vocalsound> We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny 'Kay . because you can draw with it on this page um in the <disfmarker> think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . Hmm . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . <vocalsound> Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , project <gap> project <disfmarker> what was it ? Project documents <gap> I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . Okay . Yeah . Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board . <vocalsound> We're going to uh draw animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh there's <disfmarker> I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . Okay . 'Kay . Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . <vocalsound> Uh , see you have to do it real slow . <vocalsound> Oh <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . We've got the eraser . <vocalsound> And then you can undo this easily . Yeah . <vocalsound> Pen . Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it So Okay . now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . <vocalsound> Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Hmm . Come on . You have to go really slow when you're writing . Yeah . They're brilliant animal animals . Okay . Nice . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm <disfmarker> Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . Mine is a bit more skinny . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So Yeah . if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask Yeah . Mm-hmm . I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh . So we've <disfmarker> we want different functions Yeah . uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . Mm . Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that . <vocalsound> But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . Yeah . Mm .
It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . Mm . Uh . I don't know . Okay . <vocalsound> But so mm <vocalsound> does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? Mm . we have a No , me neither . It's a <disfmarker> kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . Ah yeah . And I think it's <disfmarker> it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . Yep . Yeah Sure . Yeah . I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . Okay , yeah . Yeah . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . Okay , yeah . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , thing . <vocalsound> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh <disfmarker> Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . So we've <disfmarker> we want different functions Yeah . uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So you can see Um . Mm-hmm . Think it has to be shock proof Sure , yeah . 'cause Shock proof . my remote control tends to fall a lot . Waterproof , or uh <disfmarker> battery stays . Okay , yeah . how much is left in the battery . we've got the tool uh introduction . We move along to the project finance . <vocalsound> Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , But maybe just a little LED ,
Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> And we can all work uh on our own projects . <vocalsound> Aye sir .
move along to the project finance . <vocalsound> Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros .
Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well .
so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind ,
thing . <vocalsound> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh <disfmarker>
Um . Mm-hmm . Think it has to be shock proof Sure , yeah .
or uh <disfmarker> Shock proof . my remote control tends to fall a lot . Waterproof ,
Okay , yeah . how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . Yeah .
Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um <disfmarker>
Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet . I'm sorry , should I go back . Those were um <disfmarker> This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . Okay . Those are all the <disfmarker> Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . But there we go . I'm sure it's fine . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from <disfmarker> Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .
And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .
Thank you very much . Thank you . And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . <vocalsound> Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . <vocalsound> I'm sorry , Ch Oh , I see . Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . 'Kay . Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . Mm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ? This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Yeah . Yeah . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , Yeah .
And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . Yeah . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? Um , <vocalsound> I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing .
because I wasn't <disfmarker> But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Mm-hmm . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , Mm . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . um , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . <vocalsound> Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . I'm sorry , So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Mm-hmm . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah that's a good point . Yeah . And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . Yeah .
But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Yeah . Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Yeah . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . <vocalsound> Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . Mm-hmm . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem . Thought that was interesting . Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . Mm . <gap> the single function . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , Yeah . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it .
Yeah . That's it for the market research . Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on <gap> we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because <disfmarker> Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um <disfmarker> We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . Right . we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . Okay . Work on that . It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . <vocalsound>
Yeah . We could <disfmarker> Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . Right . Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Okay , so I <disfmarker> Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . I think it would be annoying though if <disfmarker> I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But if <disfmarker> Was it a management decision that we're having <disfmarker> It was a management decision , Okay . Yeah . So <disfmarker> so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . Okay . 'Kay . So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . I like that idea . Yeah . Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? <vocalsound> 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , <vocalsound> Minor detail there . so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use <disfmarker> It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Would it need a battery then ? Maybe , um <disfmarker> I mean the power for the T_V_ . Yeah . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah , you'll have to <disfmarker> Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? I would go for <disfmarker> It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . I just thought that <gap> it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure . But I mean <disfmarker> Um , so like big b um buttons , <gap> for people you are visually impaired . Yeah . Yeah . Could we somehow <disfmarker> We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . Mm-hmm . I mean , it's quite easily accessible . Yeah . I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , Yeah . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . So <disfmarker> Yeah . That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Okay . Mm-hmm . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? If <disfmarker> Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . Mm-hmm . It the <disfmarker> it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Oh sorry . Do you have anything to say ? <vocalsound> Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> Accessories . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . Person <disfmarker>
Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . Yeah . Before we go into uh more discussion on <gap> we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because <disfmarker> Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway .
Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option .
Right . Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um <disfmarker> We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .
Okay . Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . I think it would be annoying though if <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .
Right . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things . I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .
Yeah . Could we somehow <disfmarker> We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . Mm-hmm .
Accessories . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . Person <disfmarker> That's a good idea . Yeah . Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that . Interchangeable .
Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Yeah . Yeah . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , Yeah .
I mean the power for the T_V_ . Yeah . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah , you'll have to <disfmarker> Would it need a battery then ? Maybe , um <disfmarker>
Accessories . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . Person <disfmarker> That's a good idea . Yeah . Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that . Interchangeable .
Yeah . We could <disfmarker> Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . Right . Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Yeah . Yeah . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , Yeah .
<vocalsound> Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . <vocalsound> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . <vocalsound> Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's <disfmarker> that they're all pretty uh uh high uh <disfmarker> Large . Yeah . Yeah . A lot <disfmarker> a lot of buttons buttons . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . <vocalsound> So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . Yeah . Yeah . So , that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? Uh , well <disfmarker> We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel <gap> . Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . Okay . Or or this . And that the menu button is okay . Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Yes . Uh , so the <disfmarker> The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . <vocalsound> But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . <vocalsound> Not too much colours . Uh , no . Not too much . But uh <disfmarker> No , it's not flower power . No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh <disfmarker> and <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> S okay . Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . Okay .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , <gap> Okay . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you <disfmarker> it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice <gap> have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh <gap> it won't have to burst uh like in the <disfmarker> in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the <disfmarker> for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . <vocalsound>
because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons Hmm . uh if you <gap> push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . Uh <disfmarker> Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . Yeah , more expensive .
Yeah . But , thi i uh <disfmarker> This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , Not with an L_C_D_ . not . No , isn't . No . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . Th then you'll see it on the television . Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Yeah No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . Okay . Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? <vocalsound> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . <vocalsound> 'Cause it <disfmarker> I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . That's important . That's true . And that might uh bring back the costs uh <disfmarker> But then we'll <disfmarker> I think we must discuss who <disfmarker> uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . I can uh look on my uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . Yeah , more expensive .
So <disfmarker> Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . <vocalsound> 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend <disfmarker> uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel <disfmarker> have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . <vocalsound> To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's <disfmarker> it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be <disfmarker> uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year .
Mm-hmm . M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um Separate , more separate , h yeah . more separate , yeah . Yes , okay . Like , you have the menu button in between uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Very good . Is it better ? When you uh <gap> the menu , you have to go there there there there . I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . Yeah . Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um <disfmarker> The mute button . Sorry ? We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the <disfmarker> to to uh <disfmarker> have to uh <disfmarker> numbers Mute . And the other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Not so difficult . <vocalsound> But , uh <disfmarker> Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . But how do you wanna solve it ? With the switch button . Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . Oh , you mean like that . Yeah . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um <disfmarker> A joystick . Yeah , and joystick , I think . Yeah . But is it uh <disfmarker> Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? <vocalsound> I don't know . And <disfmarker> <gap> No , no . It won't work . For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . Yeah . Uh-huh . Or a remote control more like joystick . Yeah , but is it <disfmarker> That's not expensive than uh <disfmarker> Joystick is better . A small one . Then it's not so big . No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Oh the sh Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah , So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe , if it's possible , <vocalsound> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one . Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Mm , yeah . Then it's <disfmarker> Ch cheapest way , I think . Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . No , no kinetic . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . more expensive . Yeah . But the <disfmarker> um , it may not break . Now we put uh rubber around it . Okay . If that's possible . Um , Yeah . Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . Now , w we have to decide <vocalsound> Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at <disfmarker> 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So <disfmarker> Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface . Mm , yes . Shapes or <disfmarker> What do we need ? Can make several uh concepts . What ? Yes , okay . We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . Okay . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . A g <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , it has to be soft ? Mm . <gap> . And it has to be soft , yeah . Okay . Sorry ? Buttons . Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . <vocalsound> No , it won't . <vocalsound> But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . But if we have uh a me Yeah . It's better in <disfmarker> If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Yeah . Because uh , from h hundred uh <gap> remote controls , ninety nine have it . But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . Yeah . Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . Uh-uh . Yeah , but <vocalsound> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? <vocalsound> No . So you can't use it . And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . 'Kay . With the scroll button . That's one . And and this one has to be soft . Uh-uh . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it . Mm-hmm . It's one . Two . Number two . And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Just to uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But when you handle it , you put it on and off . It's not good to use . <vocalsound> With the scroll thing on , like this ? One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . So ? And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> Draw it . <vocalsound> Yeah , wh what <disfmarker> There for the L_C_D_ screen . Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . You have to <disfmarker> And one that way . So <disfmarker> Then it depends on the cost . S On and off . Just like a a phone .
And the buttons are on the next page . Okay . Yes . Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . Depends on the scroll . Scroll . If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh , we <disfmarker> If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Uh the most expensive . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Yes , okay . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and <disfmarker> But , it has to be small . I think . Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? If you have pistol , it <disfmarker> L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y <vocalsound> Yeah but <disfmarker> So , depends on the cost . No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . <vocalsound> Okay . Then this is the design . No , that's okay , I got <disfmarker> And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they're not uh in details . <vocalsound> It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <vocalsound> Yeah we <disfmarker> I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . <vocalsound> <gap> Then I have to come with it . So ,
Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . I can uh look on my uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Yes . It has to be ready in the next meeting . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So hurry up . Oh , that's us together . You two stay here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Mm , yeah . Then it's <disfmarker> Ch cheapest way , I think . Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .
But the <disfmarker> um , it may not break . Now we put uh rubber around it . Okay . If that's possible . Um , Yeah . Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .
And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . Okay . But I don't know uh how much higher . <vocalsound> 'Cause it <disfmarker> I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . That's important . That's true . And that might uh bring back the costs uh <disfmarker> But then we'll <disfmarker> No . So you can't use it . And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . Okay ,
Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . Okay . Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? <vocalsound> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . <vocalsound> 'Cause it <disfmarker> Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . I can uh look on my uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . Yeah , more expensive .
But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . Yeah . Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . Uh-uh . Yeah , but <vocalsound> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? <vocalsound> Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Yeah Because uh , from h hundred uh <gap> remote controls , ninety nine have it .
And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Just to uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But when you handle it , you put it on and off . It's not good to use . <vocalsound> It's one . Two . Number two .
<vocalsound> Yeah . Not so difficult . <vocalsound> But , uh <disfmarker> Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . But how do you wanna solve it ? Oh , you mean like that . Yeah . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um <disfmarker> A joystick . Yeah , and joystick , I think . Yeah . But is it uh <disfmarker> Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? <vocalsound> I don't know . And <disfmarker> <gap> No , no . It won't work . For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . Yeah . Uh-huh . Or a remote control more like joystick . Yeah , but is it <disfmarker> That's not expensive than uh <disfmarker> Joystick is better . A small one . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe , if it's possible , <vocalsound> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one .
<vocalsound> So we uh <disfmarker> we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . Yeah , s yeah , um . Mm <vocalsound> . Yours is well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . Yeah I thin but the the mic should not <disfmarker> It's not a directional mic , anyway . <vocalsound> I think it should work like this . Uh . So I will try to get my presentation running . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Can't help you with that . Last . On this normal <disfmarker> Oh oh . Alt F_ five . Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here . <vocalsound> Oh . Wow . Amazing . It's working <vocalsound> . Okay .
<vocalsound> Welcome at uh <disfmarker> at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . I hope you all have been uh updated about it . So . Yes . So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . <vocalsound> Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project . So , um <disfmarker> We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh <disfmarker> to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope <vocalsound> how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . Mm-hmm . Total . Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh <disfmarker> wh what uh what our new product should look lite <disfmarker> like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting .
When you design a new product you of <disfmarker> uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh <disfmarker> we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um <disfmarker> We <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um <disfmarker> You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright ,
I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh <disfmarker> Each of us is going . Well , what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm not really sure how this works , but <disfmarker> Okay , shall I start ? Mm . Yeah . I think you can put that . Mm-hmm . That's it . Yes , a good idea Mael . I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . So , <vocalsound> A blue and black zebra <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe <disfmarker> maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Mm-hmm . So um <disfmarker> L Why don't you draw uh <vocalsound> your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . <vocalsound> Yes , the moustache . So <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> that's definitely a cat . Mm-hmm . A horse ? It's a horse . it's a shark now . <vocalsound> This is why you're the designer . Ah it's a shark , yeah . It's not a cat , Oh . it's a dog . So . in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a white-board . Whitebo Mm-hmm . And um well it should work uh <disfmarker> I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Under documents in the shared folder . Okay . Yes . Do <disfmarker> Do we have to say something about that ?
Yeah , exactly , yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Let's continue to uh <disfmarker> to the real stuff . Wow . Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are <disfmarker> and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh <disfmarker> People uh Okay . Um <vocalsound> more interesting for our company <vocalsound> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh <vocalsound> um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . <vocalsound> So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . They have to sell at least four million to make a profit <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> So uh well Yeah . I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so So , that about finance . And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . Mm-hmm . Of course it should have a on off button . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . Mm . Yeah . We wer we were thinking television . Uh . Mm . We are targ targeting the television set . So , Mm . you need to record the channels . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> You need to browse the <disfmarker> browse the channels in upward downward way , Yes , yes .
So , Mm . you need to record the channels . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> You need to browse the <disfmarker> browse the channels in upward downward way , Yes , yes . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . Mm-hmm . Of course it should have a on off button . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
Sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer Mm-hmm . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Oh . I'm Matthew . You know . <vocalsound> Okay . Mael . Matth s uh Happy to meet you . Anna . <vocalsound> Okay . Anna . It's very uh <disfmarker> And A and I'm Nanne . um uh Matthew , yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> So Are there some other very important things to to do <disfmarker> well , So <disfmarker> to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then <disfmarker> you uh <disfmarker> it's a dog . So . Mael . It's a dog . Mm . Mm . Uh , and <disfmarker> And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or <disfmarker> I'm marketing . th So you are the marketing . Yep . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . Yeah . I wanted to to be sure .
Yes . Yeah . Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so <disfmarker> Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . Yeah . Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . Yeah . I I think <disfmarker> Uh w y you two should <disfmarker> should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . Let's <disfmarker> Let's take <disfmarker> w <vocalsound> Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Mm . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a <disfmarker> it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . So Mm . twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . Mm . <vocalsound> No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things Yeah . The <disfmarker> Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah . Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . Yeah .
And uh you <disfmarker> and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Mm-hmm . Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at Stam . basic basic television uh interface . Yeah . So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . Mm-hmm . So Perfect . next meeting will be in uh <disfmarker> in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind . Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . So you know now the basic <disfmarker> the basic things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . well just <disfmarker> just for the next meeting , um L well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean <disfmarker> so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Um you will be working on <disfmarker> on technical function design , so <disfmarker> Yeah , sure .
L well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , just <disfmarker> just for the next meeting , um
Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Um you will be working on <disfmarker> on technical function design , so <disfmarker> Yeah , sure .
And uh you <disfmarker> and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Um you will be working on <disfmarker> on technical function design , so <disfmarker> Yeah , sure .
Wow . Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are <disfmarker> and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh <disfmarker> People uh
Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . <vocalsound> So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .
Okay . Um <vocalsound> more interesting for our company <vocalsound> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh <vocalsound> um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um
We wer we were thinking television . Uh . Mm . We are targ targeting the television set . So ,
So , Mm . you need to record the channels . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> You need to browse the <disfmarker> browse the channels in upward downward way , Yes , yes . to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then <disfmarker> you uh <disfmarker> Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . Mm-hmm . Of course it should have a on off button . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
the main is browsing . Yeah . Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . Yeah . we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a <disfmarker> it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . So Mm . twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . Mm .
w <vocalsound> Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Mm . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Bless you . Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , <vocalsound> under marketing we targeted our audience , and <disfmarker> Um , yeah . That was <vocalsound> generally <vocalsound> <disfmarker> how helpful that was . <vocalsound> Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system
Sure . Okay . So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . And why not wood ? hmm ? And why not wood ? <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , well we can use wood . <vocalsound> I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .

Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material Hmm . Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the <vocalsound> is the current trend <vocalsound> Mm . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , <vocalsound> and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? <vocalsound>
so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? <vocalsound> Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use .

I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , <vocalsound> and also we need to decide whether this should be printed ,
Conceptual User Interface . Trying <disfmarker> we're gonna try to talk about , um <vocalsound> what kind of uh <disfmarker> how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . <vocalsound> And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . <vocalsound> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of <disfmarker> I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . that , like , then you hit that and then you can <disfmarker> it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ You need a screen for it ? you <disfmarker> it seems like you would need a screen . You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> you can just take theirs and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , Yeah . I I meant to update you on that . Um . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay . But the screen can come up on the telly , the <disfmarker> she said . Okay . Okay . well we just <disfmarker> we need to <disfmarker> Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> I was thinking <disfmarker> okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna <disfmarker> But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um <vocalsound> I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because <disfmarker> So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if <disfmarker> or or <disfmarker> then again if you just <disfmarker> I guess <disfmarker> I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um <disfmarker> Yeah , that's the only thing though . You have to get a <disfmarker> an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . Yeah . Like maybe it'll be that central button Yeah , yeah , yeah .
<vocalsound> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of <disfmarker> I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . You need a screen for it ? you <disfmarker> it seems like you would need a screen . You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , <vocalsound> you can just take theirs and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , Yeah . I I meant to update you on that . Um . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay . But the screen can come up on the telly , the <disfmarker> she said . Okay . Okay . well we just <disfmarker> we need to <disfmarker> Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> I was thinking <disfmarker> okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna <disfmarker> But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um <vocalsound> I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because <disfmarker> So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if <disfmarker> or or <disfmarker> Like if you just wanted to go to like <disfmarker> from five to six you could tap or someth Right . And then there's also the concern about you know um <vocalsound> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um <vocalsound> you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes Yeah , that's the only thing though . You have to get a <disfmarker> an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . Yeah .
that , like , then you hit that and then you can <disfmarker> it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , then again if you just <disfmarker> I guess <disfmarker> I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's what it does anyway . because the problem with buttons is you <disfmarker> like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , Like maybe it'll be that central button Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Like if you just wanted to go to like <disfmarker> from five to six you could tap or someth Right . And then there's also the concern about you know um <vocalsound> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um <vocalsound> you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this <disfmarker> how they actually programme these things , and if that's <disfmarker> Mean <disfmarker> Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? yeah . They already do it . you <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . it doesn't seem that hard .
If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . Yeah . Yeah . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <vocalsound> Um , right . What if <disfmarker> I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , Yeah . um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or <disfmarker> I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah definitely . Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . okay . would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a <disfmarker> Yeah I use it like that . W when we had the wheely remote control , we <disfmarker> it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . Yeah . Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can <disfmarker> What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you <disfmarker> Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can <disfmarker> so so maybe one you know <disfmarker> you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . You know you had <disfmarker> there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .
Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? <vocalsound> We we don't know . <vocalsound> Fruits and veg . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . Yeah . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <vocalsound> You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . Yeah , yeah , yeah . and you can <disfmarker> so so maybe one you know <disfmarker> you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a <disfmarker> so so maybe one you know <disfmarker> you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <vocalsound> Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can <disfmarker> you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . Yeah . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda <disfmarker> I mean definitely the area round it .
I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . Yeah , energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , And <disfmarker> which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches . Oh , a dynamo is <disfmarker> ah , <vocalsound> it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I sort of picked battery . It's quite sweet . <vocalsound> The dynamo would be interesting <vocalsound> . What does everyone else think ? <vocalsound> No . But dynamo <disfmarker> the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it <vocalsound> creates energy on its own . Oh . What about Kryptonite ? <vocalsound> Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . Yeah . Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . What does chip on print mean ?
<vocalsound> Hmm . talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .
<vocalsound> Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .
Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .
you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . Yeah . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda <disfmarker> I mean definitely the area round it .
Yeah , yeah , yeah . You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .
And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <vocalsound> Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can <disfmarker>
<disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . Yeah . Yeah . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> well I <disfmarker> see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a <disfmarker> Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can <disfmarker> so so maybe one you know <disfmarker> you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . Yeah . Don't know the cost . Didn't have enough data to actually <disfmarker> Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost . Okay . Right .
<vocalsound> Right . Well we've made our prototype anyway . We can have a good look at that . <vocalsound> You pass it round to have a look . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm very nice . Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . Mm-hmm . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit <disfmarker> the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . Mm-hmm . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . Mm-hmm . We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . <vocalsound> So it is , yeah . <vocalsound> Cherry would be alright actually . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . What's that one there ? They're thinking <disfmarker> For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . Mm-hmm . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and the the channel is in blue . Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost <vocalsound> a <disfmarker> I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . So <disfmarker> However , I've now <gap> . <vocalsound> But um , <vocalsound> yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , I'll see if I can find them . and uh <disfmarker> as I suppose that <vocalsound> so whether <vocalsound> wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose . Yeah , sis Well the colours wouldn't <disfmarker> like that's <disfmarker> they wouldn't be too important , Have <disfmarker> but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . <vocalsound> So that's where the colour buttons came from . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , okay so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And the second one underneath would be the idea for the <disfmarker> Yes , we'll have the slide-away . Right , okay .
I <gap> switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . 'Kay this should be then . <vocalsound> Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and <disfmarker>
So , we've all got a note of <disfmarker> it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . <gap> . I have a little thing .
Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it <gap> originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , Yeah . and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? Mm-hmm . Makes sense .
This <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . Oh . Sure . <vocalsound> But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Two . <vocalsound> How <disfmarker> What does <disfmarker> what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate <gap> or anything ? <vocalsound> Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be <disfmarker> I'm just gonna do this in my head . About a two . <vocalsound> Two . One point eight isn't it or something . <vocalsound> I think , anyway . So yeah , pretty close to a two . Yeah , so it's <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> So it's <disfmarker> I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . so we're still within budget on that . Um <disfmarker> Yep , that makes sense . So <gap> decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , Yep . but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the <disfmarker> I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . That's without <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on <disfmarker> Yeah , so <disfmarker> We got rid of the plastic . Yeah , we've <disfmarker> the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? Is it <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> But uh <disfmarker> So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some <disfmarker> maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . So I mean , we've got <disfmarker> we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . Yeah . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so <disfmarker> Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ? Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um <disfmarker> Do you think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . And the speech feature . Yeah , the speech feature . I mean , it's maybe not . I mean <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but <disfmarker> Yeah . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . <vocalsound> And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , Okay . so <vocalsound> I'll go over here . <vocalsound> Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Okay , well we have a single curve , which was <gap> maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . So uh <disfmarker> Okay . Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um , <vocalsound> sorry that'd be considered fancy . <vocalsound> Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . Of <disfmarker> but I think <disfmarker> What <disfmarker> Is one false , or is t one true ? I forgot . One's true . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and <disfmarker> So uh say about a two for fancy , Yeah . Okay . 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? Um , <gap> deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . D yeah . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , Um <disfmarker> we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . But not the kinetic . <vocalsound> Just made a load of money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . <vocalsound> Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? I think <disfmarker> well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . <vocalsound> On the volume ones ? And that would enable you to to do it . Okay . So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so <disfmarker> Yeah . most <disfmarker> <vocalsound> As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . Yeah . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . Yeah . Yeah , I would say so as well . Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . <vocalsound> <gap> . Say about a three maybe ? I don't know . but the moment , as it stands , it's um <disfmarker> Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . It's a two . The product is a recognisable real <disfmarker> r uh <disfmarker> reaction product ? Yeah , this is <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> And we we've we've got <disfmarker> we've got enough for another Yeah . <disfmarker> we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another <disfmarker> Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special <disfmarker> Yeah , um <disfmarker> I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because <gap> the volume buttons are different , Yeah . I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there . Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price . Okay . Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . <vocalsound> That makes sense . Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . Right . And we've got special form <vocalsound> is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be <disfmarker> You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ? You could either <vocalsound> you could have it <disfmarker> If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get <disfmarker> you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Yeah , that <disfmarker> Then there's a spe a second special form . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Okay , so tha So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , Right . Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of <disfmarker> we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . You could put in another <disfmarker> Another colour . Or would that be t Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Yeah . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . Okay . If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , That's right . which gets us um <disfmarker> In <disfmarker> right within the budget range . Mm . So that's eleven point seven , Yeah . and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . Different different colours , yeah . Alright . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . Possibly , yeah . And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the <disfmarker> maybe kind of <disfmarker> So we're going for plastic , yes ? <vocalsound> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but <disfmarker>
You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , Yeah , I suppose and then <gap> be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant . <vocalsound> Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , Yeah . Yeah . Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject <disfmarker> given subject um sometimes disjointed . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . Yeah . <vocalsound> To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay . did we find any , no . It was quite good with this um <disfmarker> the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier . We've got the closing . So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the <disfmarker> We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . Yeah . So <disfmarker> I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . Okay . so how do you reckon teamwork went ? Um <disfmarker> That went okay , yeah . Yeah , So , um <disfmarker> Creativity . Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves <vocalsound> well enough ? <vocalsound> I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . Yeah . Mm-hmm , yeah . I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . Individual meetings . How do you mean ? Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in <vocalsound> in be in-between the meetings , In you on your own . and they didn't <disfmarker> the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of <disfmarker> we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , Um <disfmarker> and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of <disfmarker> you'd probably present it at one or something like that . Mm , <gap> <disfmarker> The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would <disfmarker> normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Yeah . Then you go away . You find out information .
You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . But <gap> think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems <gap> . From the website it looks <gap> it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay . <vocalsound> I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything <disfmarker> Bit <disfmarker> bit arbitrary . <vocalsound> Well , I mean I don't think it <disfmarker> I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , Um um flow of information on on any given subject <disfmarker> given subject um sometimes disjointed . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . Yeah , the thing itself .
Right . New ideas found , so one or two . Yeah . Kinetic powered remote control . Um , what was the other one ? Voice um recognition thing . Vo yeah . Leadership , teamwork . <gap> we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . <gap> batteries , I think . So <disfmarker> <gap> voice recognition , especially not <gap> could <disfmarker> Does <disfmarker> Mm yeah . You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . Yeah . Well it's a different application of it . Mm-hmm . Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . Okay ,
Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration . <vocalsound> <gap> . Is that everything ? Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . Yeah .
Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . and then go back . Yeah . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , Yeah . so it's not uh well uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Anyway , so , Creativity , seemed okay . You pass it round to have a look . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm very nice . Also it's kind of <gap> spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than <disfmarker> kinda sleek and new age . Yeah . Um , it depends which way you look at it . Um um flow of information on on any given subject <disfmarker> given subject um sometimes disjointed . <vocalsound> Yeah . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . Mm-hmm . We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . <vocalsound> So it is , yeah . <vocalsound> Cherry would be alright actually . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . Yeah . And it does have attributes that other products do . You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . But <gap> think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . What's that one there ? But the other thing is that uh they're <disfmarker> I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer Yeah . um <vocalsound> for um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . What does <disfmarker> what do all them numbers mean then ? For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . So <disfmarker> so you've got the volume in orange on design there , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and the the channel is in blue . Alright , so we've got uh Yeah . <gap> I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . Yes , I would've thought so . Yeah , yeah Yeah . we'll make the adjustments You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . Yeah . Yeah . Well it's a different application of it . I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . Mm-hmm , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> and we do have rubber buttons anyway . So that's eleven point seven , Yeah . and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . Yeah . <vocalsound> But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership <vocalsound> So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . 'Kay this should be then . <vocalsound> Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And we we've we've got <disfmarker> we've got enough for another Yeah . <disfmarker> we've got nought point eight left , I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . However , um <disfmarker> Alright uh means , so whiteboard um <disfmarker> so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . Yeah . The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because <gap> the volume buttons are different , Yeah . I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard . Yeah . Yeah . And then we'd have <disfmarker> I can't think of a better example at the minute . Right . Yeah . Okay , uh that's probably it . Okay . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the <disfmarker> Yeah . So we only ne we only need two for that . Have <disfmarker> could have used a different example <disfmarker> pel to increase <disfmarker> create <disfmarker> Creativity . Yeah . Is this go <disfmarker> I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . Yeah . Uh , so we don't re Kinetic powered remote control . Um , Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . <vocalsound> Yeah . Now , right . <vocalsound> So shall we do a <disfmarker> Well , um <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> And specially it definitely could fits the the real product <disfmarker> Real Reaction produ R yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . It worked . Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? Uh-huh . Yeah . We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , hold on . So next year you could make <disfmarker> next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah . Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . <vocalsound> Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . so you need both of them ? Yeah . Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . Um <disfmarker> And go for battery instead . Yeah . That would give you one less . that was just about all . Yeah . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . Yeah . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ? The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it <gap> originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , Yeah . and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect <disfmarker> How it would play out , yeah . Yeah . Oh . Um <disfmarker> But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . Well , but you've got the company logo on there , Yeah . which would effectively be a stick-on badge . Okay . So you're <disfmarker> in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . Yeah . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . Okay , well we have a single curve , which was <gap> maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . Yeah . So uh <disfmarker> New ideas found , so one or two . Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Yeah . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . Yeah . So you were talking about uh um <disfmarker> We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Which m may or may not be the case . So , false is seven , true is one , and <disfmarker> So uh say about a two for fancy , Yeah . you think ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? <vocalsound> <disfmarker> plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start . Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . Alright . Okay . 'Cause you <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So we just add that to profitability in effect . So I think we can <disfmarker> we're okay . So we're okay this way around . Yeah . So that <disfmarker> Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? Yeah . I th I th <vocalsound> So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Ye And we seem to have <gap> least something in each criteria . Yeah . We haven't completely left anything out , so <disfmarker> most <disfmarker> <vocalsound> As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . Yeah . Yep . We got <disfmarker> we've we've got thirteen point seven Yeah . and we've got it in at the moment and if <disfmarker> and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . Yeah . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We should just go through this quickly and then <disfmarker> Huh . Yeah . So <disfmarker> I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . Yeah . Okay . Um , yeah . Yeah . Well um <disfmarker> I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . Individual meetings . How do you mean ? Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in <vocalsound> in be in-between the meetings , Mm , <gap> <disfmarker> The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would <disfmarker> normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Yeah . Then you go away .
And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the <disfmarker> maybe kind of <disfmarker> So we're going for plastic , yes ? <vocalsound> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but <disfmarker>
Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . Yeah , Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Yeah . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . Okay .
Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? I think <disfmarker> well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . <vocalsound> On the volume ones ?
Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . <vocalsound> And that I think <disfmarker> Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . <vocalsound> On the volume ones ?
'Kay this should be then . <vocalsound> Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and <disfmarker>
Do you think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . And the speech feature . Yeah , the speech feature .
Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ? Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um <disfmarker> Do you think <disfmarker>
so we're still within budget on that . Um <disfmarker> Yep , that makes sense . So <gap> decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , Yep . which would be <disfmarker> come from the button supplements category . I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better . And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the <disfmarker> maybe kind of <disfmarker> So we're going for plastic , yes ? <vocalsound> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but <disfmarker> Yep .
<disfmarker> And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . <vocalsound> And that So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be <vocalsound> a different shape . I would s Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . <vocalsound> I don't know .
Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . <vocalsound> I mean , it's maybe not . I mean <disfmarker> <gap> just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . Well , but you've got the company logo on there , Yeah . which would effectively be a stick-on badge . Okay . Yeah . Oh .
The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , Hmm . <gap> so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . Mm . <vocalsound> Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or <disfmarker> I'm still not quite sure we've established that . No ,
<vocalsound> L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . Right . <vocalsound> Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . 'Kay . Uh the trends . <vocalsound> It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , and uh same for this one . <vocalsound> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
Uh these are the new colours of this year . <vocalsound> So it must be very bright , very colourful . <vocalsound> And that's uh also for the younger public . B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits Well <disfmarker> Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told . <vocalsound>
Yeah , well <disfmarker> Bananas . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh <vocalsound> well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something ,
I agree . And I <disfmarker> Then I have some more findings . Um <vocalsound> uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . <vocalsound> And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , <vocalsound> But we'll return to that . Yeah ? Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . <vocalsound> Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .
<vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Um it's not really speech recognition , That's interesting . it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Right . No it doesn't does not do anything . No . so we could use them now .
uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said ,
How <disfmarker> How <disfmarker> Hmm ? Can you draw it now ? Ah .
<vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . Yeah . Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? Yeah just uh the numbers . <vocalsound> And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? <gap> Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . I'd <disfmarker> I agree . Yeah , fine . <vocalsound>
and spea speaker at the back , or something . Microphone , yeah . Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . <vocalsound> Yeah I understand . Well , it's just a choice . You have uh redundancy . But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . <gap> Or don't <disfmarker> Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Why would you put it uh then ,
Okay . Uh door is closed . <vocalsound> Mm . I think that's a nice trade-off . Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , but uh just very small . <vocalsound> But readable enough of course . Okay . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo but <disfmarker> But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . No , it isn't . Right ? Wood is popular . Aha . Okay . We don't want wood . Okay . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest <disfmarker> Mm . So <gap> we have to uh take that one . Okay . So it it <vocalsound> it isn't very important that <vocalsound> that it works easy . So we have titanium . <vocalsound> The front is the most important . <vocalsound> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . Yeah . You know what ? And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . Yeah . But it <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> Alright . Yeah . Okay . Ha , even more . N
It's good marketing . Mm . Launch different lines at once . So e th then a c couple of basic colours . We thing that fruit and bright colours are <disfmarker> Yeah the the the front w I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine ,
We all agree on that . Yeah . Mm . Industry designer , <gap> . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . Yeah ,
<gap> , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications .
But we'll return to that . Yeah ? Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff .
<vocalsound> Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .
And that's uh also for the younger public . B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . Yeah , that's great . Yeah .
<vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If it's cheap . Yeah . Hmm . Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . <vocalsound> Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . Yeah . Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? Yeah just uh the numbers . <vocalsound> And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? <gap> Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . I'd <disfmarker> I agree . Yeah , fine . <vocalsound>
Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . <vocalsound> Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and <gap> uh and that kind of stuff <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Maybe a a cheap voice recording . Well <disfmarker> Yes . Alright . Individual actions . We all agree on that . Yeah . Mm .
Okay . Uh door is closed . <vocalsound> Mm . I think that's a nice trade-off . Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah ? Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Um round . Round I think . Yeah . Round . Yeah I I I also uh thought <disfmarker> Yeah . but uh just very small . <vocalsound> But readable enough of course . Okay . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo but <disfmarker> But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . No , it isn't . Right ? Wood is popular . Aha . Okay . We don't want wood . Okay . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest <disfmarker> Mm . So <gap> we have to uh take that one . Okay . So it it <vocalsound> it isn't very important that <vocalsound> that it works easy . So we have titanium . <vocalsound> The front is the most important . <vocalsound> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . Yeah . You know what ? And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . Yeah . But it <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> Alright . Yeah . Okay . Ha , even more . N
So round where ? So uh a little corner of titanium . Yeah , Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah .
all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well uh
Yeah , right . Two . Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , It's good marketing . Mm . Launch different lines at once . So e th then a c couple of basic colours . We thing that fruit and bright colours are <disfmarker> Yeah the the the front w I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine ,
<vocalsound> But readable enough of course . Okay . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . and logo also on the front but not exchange uh <disfmarker> Uh ? Hmm ? <vocalsound> <gap> Uh when changing fronts . But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You c <vocalsound> But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the <disfmarker> Yeah , right . Ah the logo should be on the top I think . The logo <disfmarker> Yeah they do . Well yeah . Yeah . Right corner , yes . And well you c
Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .
But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <vocalsound> No but you have titanium of course . So maybe <disfmarker> Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So <disfmarker> No no no .
<vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Um it's not really speech recognition , That's interesting . it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Right . No it doesn't does not do anything . No . so we could use them now .
<vocalsound> No uh I nei . <vocalsound> Titanium is very <disfmarker> No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . Hmm . But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . Well but <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> But readable enough of course . Okay . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . and logo also on the front but not exchange uh <disfmarker> Uh ? Hmm ? <vocalsound> <gap> Uh when changing fronts . <vocalsound> Let's start the design . Oh we can uh decide how we implement <vocalsound> the feeling from our company into the remote . Well yeah . Um I think um <vocalsound> a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , why not ? <vocalsound> If there's enough space , <vocalsound> you can put uh <disfmarker> Uh I I'd say only the logo . We'll we'll <disfmarker> Yeah . Me too . Too much text and it gets too too busy . Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple <disfmarker> But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You c <vocalsound> But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the <disfmarker> Yeah , right . Ah the logo should be on the top I think . The logo <disfmarker> Yeah they do . Well yeah . Yeah . Right corner , yes . And well you c
So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . <vocalsound> And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <vocalsound> and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay ,
Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , Mm . or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . <vocalsound> Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um <vocalsound> using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um <vocalsound> complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . Hmm . Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , So those are our options . Um personal preferences that I was thinking through <disfmarker> here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything Mm . which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . <vocalsound> Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . <vocalsound> Is double-curved like <disfmarker> would be like two hands kind of thing ? I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . Sounds good . Yeah , I wonder <disfmarker> I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite <disfmarker> they're marketing quite hard to us Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you <disfmarker> Yeah , n no idea , no idea . no idea , okay . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , Mm-hmm . oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that . but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh
G oh , geez . Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include <disfmarker> that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . that's what we don't want . <vocalsound> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple . Here's a a fairly simple device . Hmm . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um <vocalsound> the thing I like about this is that Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um <vocalsound> here's a another example . This is uh <disfmarker> it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Mm . and and you can sort of <disfmarker> yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I <vocalsound> I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels .
Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . <vocalsound> Okay . So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? I think that's <vocalsound> that's one way to go , yes . Okay . Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , Mm-hmm . There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're <vocalsound> I <vocalsound> we're <disfmarker> I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , Right . but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a <vocalsound> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's <disfmarker> um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Well <disfmarker> if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a <disfmarker> No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . Okay .
really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . <vocalsound> And then <vocalsound> the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , <vocalsound> tight material . <vocalsound> S sweet . <vocalsound> And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with <vocalsound> fruit and vegetable padding . <vocalsound> Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so <vocalsound> I don't know how much of it we necessarily <vocalsound> wanna take away . <vocalsound> Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to <vocalsound> like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . <vocalsound> Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So first um they had people <disfmarker> they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . Okay . <vocalsound> The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi
Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <gap> Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . If it's latex <disfmarker> if it's latexy <disfmarker> It's kind of <disfmarker> and then it <disfmarker> An uh I <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> th <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's <disfmarker> there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to <disfmarker> R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things Mm-hmm . you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , Yeah . I don't know what th that material's called . Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's <disfmarker> that seems doable . <vocalsound> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . The buttons could be fruit-shaped . Could they be smelly ? <vocalsound> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . <vocalsound> Oh God . isn't it ? <vocalsound> Maybe , Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <vocalsound> Like large button , If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . that's what I was thinking of , yeah . What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . <gap> be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could <disfmarker> Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , Like , to make it different fruits . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Just to tie it in a little . Might <disfmarker> would you think you you <disfmarker> do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is <disfmarker>
And you find that works quite well ? I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . Yeah The button on an iPod , is it <disfmarker> what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? It's like five , Ts Right . and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . Oh , I see , right , yeah . Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . Yeah , that's quite a good design . I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Yeah . And then you could still have that available . Yeah , I think an <vocalsound> L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . I think it could be difficult in practice , so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this <disfmarker> these kinds of things , <vocalsound> 'Kay . Yeah , it's possible . Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Exactly . Okay , um <vocalsound> components concept . Energy , chip on print . Uh-hu oh , oh yes . can you just explain what that is real quick ? so um Mm-hmm . Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <vocalsound> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . Am I <disfmarker> Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good . Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're <vocalsound> they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . <vocalsound> I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I did f Okay . Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard . Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Right . Um , <vocalsound> 'kay , the pushbutton <disfmarker> if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . Oh . <vocalsound> It would be nice for changing the volume , Uh but <disfmarker> but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . I don't think it would really work . Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . Yeah , We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as <disfmarker> I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . Yeah . or for all those secret functions ? F When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um <disfmarker> Right . Okay , let's do case . Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . Yeah . Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? Uh yeah , everything I've <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <vocalsound> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Mm-hmm . Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <vocalsound> then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? Well , Or both ? Um <disfmarker> And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip I think that <disfmarker> yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll <disfmarker> an actual <disfmarker> like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , Yeah . I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , Mm-hmm . but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . It might be cool enough . Yeah . Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , Yep . and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ? So we're gonna have like a menu button , Yep . Alright . Um in <disfmarker> we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . So Yeah . On off , On off <disfmarker> uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . So like one through five , or <disfmarker> about <disfmarker> yeah like <disfmarker> yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um <disfmarker> Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . No . I think maybe numbers seems <disfmarker> is kind of old-fashioned . Well , Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Simple chip .
um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .
Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <vocalsound> um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <vocalsound> um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .

We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design .
I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case Mm-hmm . Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <vocalsound> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . Am I <disfmarker> Mm-hmm .
Okay , let's do case . Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . Yeah .

It might be cool enough .
Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <vocalsound>
'cause then we can have a a simple chip Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , Yep . Or both ? Um <disfmarker> And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons ,
So we're gonna have like a menu button , Yep . Yeah . On off , On off <disfmarker> uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . So like one through five , or <disfmarker> about <disfmarker> yeah like <disfmarker> yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um <disfmarker> Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero ,
Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Simple chip .
Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod .

The alternative is to have a <vocalsound> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's <disfmarker> um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Well <disfmarker> if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a <disfmarker> No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . Okay .
Okay , let's do case . Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . Yeah . Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? Uh yeah , everything I've <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <vocalsound> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Mm-hmm . An uh I <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> th <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's <disfmarker> there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to <disfmarker> R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things Mm-hmm . Yeah , it's possible . Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Exactly .
Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <vocalsound> Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <gap> I don't know what th that material's called . Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's <disfmarker> that seems doable . <vocalsound> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . The buttons could be fruit-shaped . Could they be smelly ? <vocalsound> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . <vocalsound> Oh God . isn't it ? <vocalsound> Maybe , Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <vocalsound> Like large button , If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . that's what I was thinking of , yeah . What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . <gap> be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could <disfmarker> Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , Like , to make it different fruits . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's possible . Yeah , <vocalsound> Just to tie it in a little . Might <disfmarker> would you think you you <disfmarker> do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is <disfmarker> and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Exactly .
which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . <vocalsound> I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , An uh I <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> th <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , I did f Okay . Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard .
Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Right . Um , <vocalsound> 'kay , the pushbutton <disfmarker> if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced .
And you find that works quite well ? I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . Yeah The button on an iPod , is it <disfmarker> what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? It's like five , Ts Right . and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . Oh , I see , right , yeah . Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . Yeah , that's quite a good design . I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Yeah . Or both ? Um <disfmarker> And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip I think that <disfmarker> yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll <disfmarker> an actual <disfmarker> like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , Yeah . but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . Oh . <vocalsound> It would be nice for changing the volume , Uh but <disfmarker> but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . I don't think it would really work . I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . Yeah , I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , Mm-hmm . but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . It might be cool enough . We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as <disfmarker> I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . Yeah . or for all those secret functions ? F When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um <disfmarker> Right .
then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? Well ,
Alright , that did nothing . Okay . Welcome to the meeting everyone . Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . <gap> I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . <vocalsound> The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . <vocalsound>
And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . Okay . So this is a television remote control ? Yes , it's a television remote control . Yeah . Yeah . And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , <vocalsound> is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer .
Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um ,
<vocalsound> right now it is an elk . An elk ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> It's a dog . <vocalsound> . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , That's a sketching of my my elk , <vocalsound> and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , <vocalsound> Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Bit more cartoon style . <vocalsound> But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> There you go . <vocalsound> Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure <vocalsound> how to draw one . okay cool , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , <vocalsound>
Be like a shell-shaped remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Yeah . but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable <disfmarker> So , hmm . Yeah . And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Yeah . So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , Okay . um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um <disfmarker> or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um <gap> selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can <disfmarker> like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty . it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . Mm-hmm . I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking <vocalsound> device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . <vocalsound> Do yous not find that , um , <vocalsound> like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . Yeah . Yeah , I don't know what they do . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . Yeah .
So , just to cover <disfmarker> We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Yeah . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . Interface ? Industrial Designer . Industrial Designer . Oh , industrial . That's me . <vocalsound> I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . Mm-hmm . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , <vocalsound> maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour ,
Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . Interface ? Industrial Designer . Industrial Designer . Oh , industrial . That's me . <vocalsound> I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . Mm-hmm .
You'll be beginning your , your working design . Mm-hmm . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , <vocalsound> maybe how this can be achieved ,
Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , <vocalsound> maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour .
Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Marketing Expert .
So this is a television remote control ? Yes , it's a television remote control . Yeah .
um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um <disfmarker> or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um <gap> selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um
And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can <disfmarker> like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means .
Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market .
Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . Okay ,
So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , <vocalsound> to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it <vocalsound> to be uh to feel spongy , Like a banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . Mm-hmm . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So
<vocalsound> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . Mm-hmm . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . Mm-hmm . So for the financial aspect it's okay , <vocalsound> we can uh <disfmarker> we can continue with this product uh as if , <vocalsound> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
we can uh <disfmarker> we can continue with this product uh as if , <vocalsound> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to <vocalsound> the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through Okay . okay so uh we have uh six points . We So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , <vocalsound> easy to find in a room , and robust , Yeah . Mm-hmm . uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Yeah . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , Yeah . and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? Okay . And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . Mm-hmm .
okay ? <vocalsound> Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? Okay . Maybe you can presen <vocalsound> F between o one and seven . okay . Maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> hold it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I think it's uh very uh very nice . I give it a <disfmarker> I give it a five . What do you think ? Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Yeah . Seven is the highest uh ? <vocalsound> Seven is the <disfmarker> I will give a six . I will give a a five . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> No , I just want to see something <disfmarker> Maybe we all have to agree on a common <disfmarker> Well , Need to <disfmarker> So uh I don't know if you <disfmarker> we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or <disfmarker> this is your <disfmarker> Well , we can choose what we want . Yeah . Okay , Or maybe we can say s let's say that seven is the best . seven is the best mm <vocalsound> . Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , Five . Oh sorry . <vocalsound> Six <disfmarker> How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? Uh s you can <disfmarker> yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh <disfmarker> So it will have five point five average . Five point five average . <vocalsound> Okay . So after , the technological aspect ? Okay , techne technological aspect . So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . Yeah , we have the wheel . Uh . We also have the rubber material , which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five . It's <gap> four . Four ? A four also , Yeah . because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . The rubber is <disfmarker> are we including the voice <disfmarker> are you glu Uh a four . I I <disfmarker> are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? No . No . Okay . So No . what's your uh grade ? Yeah . For twenty five . Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four . Everyone is okay Okay . Doesn't it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so . Yeah . I give a seven , I think . Six . I would give a <disfmarker> I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use . Mm , six for me also . Six . Six point five . <vocalsound> 'Kay . six point five . Six six six point five . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Is it fashion ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . Seven ? <vocalsound> I would say seven . And is very very nice design . Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the <disfmarker> Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah . Yeah . Well , we hope . <vocalsound> Easy to find . <vocalsound> Uh easy to find in a room ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I lost my banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think you can't miss it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here . We have the lightning , or <disfmarker> we have <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> we don't sesh especially have the lightning <vocalsound> So you'll make the material transparent <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> so that it uh lights up completely , or <disfmarker> I think it's very easy to <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Seven ? I would say seven . <vocalsound> Six . Is it <disfmarker> is it robust ? Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , Uh f yeah , Yeah the only problem there might be <disfmarker> which <gap> know , i if it's very sensitive , Yeah . Yeah . I don't know <disfmarker> But it is uh <disfmarker> it is surrounded by rubber material . Yeah , okay . Yeah . So maybe we can put a six . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Everybody is okay , six . Six or five . Five <vocalsound> now <vocalsound> um so . Tadada . We have to sum up everything . Twenty . That's that's okay ? Six . <vocalsound> Six is a good <disfmarker> Okay . Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , Yeah , the top <disfmarker>
Yeah , the be . and when uh s six sit six are good <disfmarker> it's a good uh p product , I think . Okay , so So will become eight soon ? So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising . Yeah , well it's a bit biased . <vocalsound> We have a good price Huh . Okay . Good . So this prototype is quite nice . <vocalsound> Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , Just a <vocalsound> just a phone , wireless . Mm-hmm . So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . Yeah .
So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . <vocalsound> So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . <vocalsound> Okay so congratulation . <vocalsound> Congratulations to the team . Yeah . <vocalsound> Nice product . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it was a good collaboration uh . <vocalsound> So I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . <vocalsound> The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
<vocalsound> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . Mm-hmm . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So Mm-hmm . So for the financial aspect it's okay , <vocalsound> we can uh <disfmarker> we can continue with this product uh as if , <vocalsound> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . Yeah , well it's a bit biased . <vocalsound> We have a good price Huh . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . <vocalsound> The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
Okay . Good . So this prototype is quite nice . <vocalsound> Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . Yeah , the be . and when uh s six sit six are good <disfmarker> it's a good uh p product , I think . Okay , so So will become eight soon ? So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising . and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a <disfmarker> leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries Yeah . and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , <gap> but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time .
Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um <vocalsound> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional <disfmarker> uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . <vocalsound> Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third <vocalsound> Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
No . And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display <disfmarker> th uh the remote control display thing . We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . Um . Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the <disfmarker> Into the method . and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't <disfmarker> un unfortunately aren't available . 'Kay . <vocalsound> . Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we <disfmarker> I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , Wa <vocalsound> Like a <disfmarker> right , okay . So you wind up your remote control before you use it . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get <disfmarker> when when you got T_V_ . That doesn't count though does it ? Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . Yeah , okay . Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . Okay . The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches Yeah I've seen <disfmarker> and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . And are these like uh <disfmarker> what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? Um yeah And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out <gap> . But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time Could I just ask <disfmarker> referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? Mm . I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing or the two things not compatible ? Like a dual kind of . but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they <disfmarker> because , if you lie <gap> <disfmarker> on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . Mm . I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? It's twelve point f Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , Again it de sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . Mm . Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Yeah . and it's <disfmarker> Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally <disfmarker> the eternal battle for control of the controls . <vocalsound> It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , No . So <disfmarker> Okay . But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . Okay , right . uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which <disfmarker> pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit Well well this <disfmarker> the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that And then to <disfmarker> uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was <disfmarker> 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . Okay . Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the <disfmarker> there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case <disfmarker> case housing Mm-hmm . and the the main problems with the <disfmarker> well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , Mm . so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite <vocalsound> um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more <disfmarker> they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not <disfmarker> for the flip phone . Hinged , yeah . yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , Yeah . you call it a skin or whatever . So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . Mm . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . Yeah , yeah . I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , Rubber , yeah . that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . And you can peel them off yeah . So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , Yeah . Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . Mm . Yeah . that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen <disfmarker> 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could <disfmarker> becau you could fit it <disfmarker> Uh-huh . the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve <disfmarker> curved things with it , Okay . I don't <disfmarker> s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh it would be flat inside . yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , Mm . so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , 'Kay . w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . Mm-hmm . I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . Is rubber . I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to <vocalsound> . Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out Like one of the palm pop thing . but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , Mm .
Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Yeah . and it's <disfmarker> Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally <disfmarker> the eternal battle for control of the controls . <vocalsound> It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , No . But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . Okay . The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches So <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah I've seen <disfmarker> and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . Okay , right . Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the <disfmarker> there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case <disfmarker> case housing Mm-hmm . well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , Mm . so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons ,
Hmm . Okay . So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the <disfmarker> for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it <disfmarker> this at a low cost , but for <disfmarker> like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . Yeah . So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . Yeah . My personal preferences would be like , as already <gap> uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh Mm . like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , Yeah . so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety Mm . and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . Yeah . And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . Mm . Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top Yeah . and g graphic user interface Which means <disfmarker> basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , Okay . So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? <gap>
example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the <disfmarker> for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it <disfmarker> this at a low cost , but for <disfmarker> like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . Yeah . So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . Yeah .
Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on <disfmarker> Do we agree on the battery ? Kinetic ? The kinetic . Yeah . Yeah . Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having <disfmarker> Mm . so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . Yeah I think <disfmarker> I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , Yeah . Mm . Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , The L_C_D_'s not cheap . Hmm . I mean they use them in calculators so . Yeah , okay . Maybe we could start with the black and white . Yeah . we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? Mm . 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch <disfmarker> a battery that goes in a watch . I oh I see . Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? Yeah . what did you give us as our <disfmarker> The bare-board L_C_D_ or <disfmarker> Yeah the <disfmarker> well I think were <disfmarker> we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , <gap> okay and then <disfmarker> On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Sorry could you repeat that last part ? Um , okay on <disfmarker> we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . L_C_D_ screen . sorry . For the body design I think plastic , Plastic , Mm-hmm , <gap> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , Plast right . and it is just uh <disfmarker> although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , Mm no . if we've got a kind of different shape anyway Okay . um the fact <disfmarker> the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . Mm . This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more <disfmarker> And you would just have an <disfmarker> across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <disfmarker> Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , the whistle ones , yeah . So we can <disfmarker> if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . And incorporating the company logo ? Yep . but we'll be incorporating in the design . Mm . 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product Okay . Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . Yeah . and that does the work for you . Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently Okay . Okay . Did we <disfmarker> I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? Depending on how i <vocalsound> Yeah , depending on the expense of it . I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so
okay and then <disfmarker> On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Sorry could you repeat that last part ? Um , okay on <disfmarker> we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . L_C_D_ screen . sorry . For the body design I think plastic , Plastic , Mm-hmm , <gap> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , Plast right . and it is just uh <disfmarker> although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , Mm no . if we've got a kind of different shape anyway Okay . um the fact <disfmarker> the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on <disfmarker> Do we agree on the battery ? Kinetic ? The kinetic . Yeah . Yeah . Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having <disfmarker> I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . Mm . This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more <disfmarker> And you would just have an <disfmarker> across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <disfmarker> Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , The L_C_D_'s not cheap .

Yeah . we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? Mm . 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch <disfmarker> a battery that goes in a watch . I oh I see . what did you give us as our <disfmarker> The bare-board L_C_D_ or <disfmarker> Yeah the <disfmarker> well I think were <disfmarker> we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , <gap>
Mm . so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . Yeah I think <disfmarker> Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah . So we can <disfmarker> if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . And incorporating the company logo ? I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? Depending on how i <vocalsound> Yeah , depending on the expense of it . I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , Yeah .
okay and then <disfmarker> On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Sorry could you repeat that last part ? Um , okay on <disfmarker> we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . L_C_D_ screen . Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah . So we can <disfmarker> if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . And incorporating the company logo ? Mm-hmm , <gap> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , Plast right . Do we agree on the battery ? Kinetic ? The kinetic . Yeah . Mm . so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . Yeah I think <disfmarker> I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , Yeah . And you would just have an <disfmarker> across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <disfmarker> Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , what did you give us as our <disfmarker> The bare-board L_C_D_ or <disfmarker> Yeah the <disfmarker> well I think were <disfmarker> we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , <gap>
and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't <disfmarker> un unfortunately aren't available . 'Kay . Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we <disfmarker>
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't <disfmarker> un unfortunately aren't available . 'Kay . There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we <disfmarker> Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . Um the minutes from the last time .
What's the agenda for this meeting ? The <disfmarker> I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you . Okay . Perfect . So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting Mm-hmm . and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but <vocalsound> then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Next . Um . So y you are the secretary also . Yes . Indeed . Right ? Okay . Then I hope you all have uh worked out <vocalsound> some some uh <vocalsound> some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . <gap> Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh <vocalsound> start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions Mm-hmm . and <disfmarker> Well in this meeting we should really <vocalsound> try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the <disfmarker> Mm . You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , Mm . Uh . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good . Um . Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? No , I don't . Uh you want a table to to uh I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it
I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . Mm-hmm . Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um . It's <disfmarker> probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um . Mm-hmm . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . Mm . Um . Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ? I have an a web page yes . Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this . Yep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um <vocalsound> and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Mm . Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um . Mm . An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , Yes yes , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um . I have <vocalsound> that too <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . Mm . Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep . Okay too much time to learn . Okay . Um . And thirty <disfmarker> twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Not enough <gap> I don't know how we'd go about combating that . <gap> . What do you mean there ? Yeah . That's what the report says yeah . So mm . Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the <disfmarker> on <disfmarker> Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . You can disconnect it there Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . Hmm . <vocalsound> Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . Speech recognition in <disfmarker> And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . D do you have numbers o o on that ? Well potentially yeah , um <disfmarker> it would be all based on speech . Okay . I think even for interesti Interesting idea . yeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options . Okay . Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my <disfmarker> well it's <disfmarker> we should be in range , Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . Yeah . But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for <vocalsound> for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents <vocalsound> . Well No you can't . And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , Mm . But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting . Mm . you had to to to summarise maybe the <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . Mm . Yeah , <vocalsound> it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , Mm . <vocalsound> Mm . which we'll be talking about later I think . Yes . We will talk about it later . <vocalsound> that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . Okay . Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that . Mm . Okay . <vocalsound> um
So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um <vocalsound> is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . Mm . <vocalsound> So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . Mm-hmm . And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit Mm-hmm . and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first <vocalsound> the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . Mm . for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna Mm-hmm . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want <vocalsound> . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh <disfmarker> it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh <gap> the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , Mm . right . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's <disfmarker> my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right . Mm-hmm . So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is <vocalsound> very quick uh design , Mm-hmm . And um so what I have found and <vocalsound> after a lot of work actually I <vocalsound> I draw this I draw for you this uh schema <vocalsound> Well . You drew it a long time ago ? Is huh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that Ninety one . <vocalsound> overwhelming <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . No . <vocalsound> And and why do you want these kind of component ? So . So I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your <disfmarker> found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , Mm . but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components Mm-hmm . What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . Of course yeah . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . Yeah . We will use uh <vocalsound> infrared protocol uh using <vocalsound> yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists Mm-hmm . and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting <vocalsound> the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies . The frequencies ? in the chip you have it <vocalsound> But you should be careful , yeah . people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s <vocalsound> , so basically <gap> through all the things . That can control o other things . Of course yeah we should take that into account Yeah yes I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm . and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right .
sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch <vocalsound> . And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those Mm-hmm . Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ Mm-hmm . So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys
there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but <vocalsound> tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh <vocalsound> this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any ,
you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . Mm-hmm . And then <vocalsound> well personal preferences I would <disfmarker> uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the <disfmarker> we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote <disfmarker> video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with <disfmarker> Okay . How would that work ? So and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , Yeah . so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? or does it know which one you want to use ? Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing Mm-hmm . but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option Mm-hmm . like um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you Mm-hmm . suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you Mm-hmm . you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . Mm . In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities <vocalsound> . Mm . Mm mm mm mm mm . Mm . These are kind of next generation <vocalsound> functionalities . It's the next generation thing , but I think it's i i it's already there , It's goi I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop . Yeah So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . Mm . That's fair enough . Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . No no we are not making a universal remote , which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me . Mm . Because y W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . Mm-hmm . Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently <vocalsound> booming up actually Mm-hmm .
Um , so u um Yeah . I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's that's especially because of the internet of course . Hmm . So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . Mm . Mm . Um . further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? <vocalsound> Mm . And and and the hard disk recorders . Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh <vocalsound> y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which Mm-hmm . Um therefore , <vocalsound> younger people like trendy <disfmarker> trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . Hmm .
Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh <disfmarker> Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , Yeah Because they are already used to that , you know , product . mo that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , Yes it's recognisable <gap> yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . Okay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Mael can you hand me over this uh ? Mm-hmm . Okay . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? Mm well I think fi five min 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all Forty minutes ? Yeah so Mm-hmm . you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . <vocalsound> too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Mm . so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . Yeah . Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control <vocalsound> <disfmarker> wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? <vocalsound> Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better . But it's not going to have more functionality , Mm-hmm . 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might <disfmarker> we'll be able to <vocalsound> beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , Mm-hmm . they have to actually need it as well . So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . Mm . I <disfmarker> well I think <vocalsound> many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one Mm . So that will be about functionality <disfmarker> Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <disfmarker> Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , What do <disfmarker> What do you think about <disfmarker> we're not building a high end product . Yeah What componen we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ Mm . and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps Mm-hmm . and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . Mm . But <disfmarker> yeah . If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that that's <disfmarker> which would drive the cost up a lot . I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . Ye If you <disfmarker> mm . I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . And quite complicated to use , S so we can try to go in between , yes . and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated Mm-hmm . yeah . <vocalsound> Universal . because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Okay . So they're <disfmarker> People <disfmarker> yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? Mm . <vocalsound> I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . <vocalsound> So d Do you agree ? Well <disfmarker> Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . <vocalsound> Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million Uh and it d uh <disfmarker> Our provin Yeah . Okay . Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . Uh yeah , Mm . Mm . Okay . Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other <disfmarker> Yeah that's needed , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . And if we want to get the market , we really need that . Yeah . Yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . Actu Yes . Exactly . <vocalsound> Yeah . And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . Is that okay for you ?
So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content Yes . Mm . Okay . Okay . and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . Mm-hmm yep . that's that's fine then . Okay . and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good Mm-hmm . yes , we uh we can have lunch now . Mm-hmm . we meet in <disfmarker> well <vocalsound> what are our <disfmarker> Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . But you will be informed via the computer . Okay .
So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content
given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content Yes .
Okay . Okay . and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . Mm-hmm yep . Mm .
But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . Mm yes And and and the hard disk recorders . Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh <vocalsound> y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Okay .
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Um therefore , <vocalsound> younger people like trendy <disfmarker> trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . Hmm .
Yeah . Okay . Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . Uh yeah , Mm . Mm . Okay . Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other <disfmarker> Yeah that's needed , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . And if we want to get the market , we really need that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . Is that okay for you ? So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content So that will be about functionality <disfmarker> Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <disfmarker> Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , What do <disfmarker> What do you think about <disfmarker> we're not building a high end product . Yeah But <disfmarker> yeah . If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that that's <disfmarker> which would drive the cost up a lot . I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . Ye That's fair enough . Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . No no we are not making a universal remote ,
So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <disfmarker> Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ Mm .
that's that's fine then . Okay . and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . Is that okay for you ?
Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ? Yep . Yeah . So does anyone have any overall <gap> Well <vocalsound> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <vocalsound> no teletext , people are very comfortable <vocalsound> with <vocalsound> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not <disfmarker> we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . Mm . And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than <disfmarker> Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet <disfmarker> <vocalsound> there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . <vocalsound> Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side Okay . which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that <vocalsound> identifies our product as better than <disfmarker> because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . So that's that's that was my reactions . Okay . Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . Yeah yeah . So we're quite fixed . Yep . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . <vocalsound> Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . Hmm . So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we <disfmarker> people use our remote with . Yeah . I think we take with you . So it's kind of a stupid decision . But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement <disfmarker> wants it as <vocalsound> cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took <disfmarker> they can't ac access their teletext . Mm . Okay . 'Cause we're talking about <vocalsound> eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . K yeah . So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , Okay I think that the <vocalsound> last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the <disfmarker> w it has to be branded . So then the double R_ will be our our <disfmarker> 'Kay . On the product yeah . I think one of <disfmarker> Can you handle that black and yellow ? I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this <disfmarker> I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of <disfmarker> our target here is to <vocalsound> have some kind of very like sleek <vocalsound> nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . You know we don't wanna a big clunker . Mm . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so <disfmarker> So you have this ?
This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . We're talking about existing technology . No . Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . Yeah this is just <disfmarker> this is just a basic layout of ev <vocalsound> of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that <vocalsound> I mean <vocalsound> that you can kinda say would <vocalsound> would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . Okay . Okay . Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . 'Kay . Uh I don't have any figures right now . 'Kay . We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . Yeah . N okay . Um but <disfmarker> and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . Mm . Okay . So yeah . That's all I have really . Okay . Thanks . Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ? so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . <vocalsound> We need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which <disfmarker> and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . So <vocalsound> those are the basic components that need to go into this
Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . 'Kay . So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h <vocalsound> you know how much power . Mm 'kay .
Mm 'kay This doesn't work . <vocalsound> So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . <vocalsound> And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh <disfmarker> that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the <disfmarker> to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their <disfmarker> the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but <vocalsound> um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the <disfmarker>
um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but <vocalsound> um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the <disfmarker> But I t I think what the <vocalsound> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . Mm-hmm . Because otherwise we're just going to <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> even if it's necessary or not , if you <disfmarker> if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really <disfmarker> if it i <vocalsound> if it isn't more expensive for us to k make <disfmarker> because as far as I understand it , <vocalsound> it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? Right as far as <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . So it should be in there . i it's just uh <vocalsound> the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference . I think . <vocalsound> I have maybe a silly question . I <disfmarker> in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the <disfmarker> it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext <disfmarker> h how <disfmarker> why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that . Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do . Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that <vocalsound> you would use <disfmarker> you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that Scheduling . and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . I think I ha Yeah 'cause , yeah , I agree . I just <disfmarker> I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the <disfmarker> the remote is is used for television , okay . Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah . Unless you have a <disfmarker> Well there there is a <disfmarker> for example on digital T_V_ systems you have <disfmarker> you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . Mm-hmm . A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can <disfmarker> Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , Okay . but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and <disfmarker> <gap> I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . Mm . But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's <vocalsound> , for example , a trainable one then we're <vocalsound> just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . Yeah Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know <disfmarker> Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . Yeah . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , Yeah . I just I I <disfmarker> Yeah , and neither do I in fact . but I'm not a tech-mind either . I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . Yeah . but we're not putting some <disfmarker> there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . That's <disfmarker> yeah , That's the problem . and and we're also <vocalsound> marketing a product . It's <disfmarker> what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing Mm . So if we drop <disfmarker> if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? Hmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? Yeah . I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . Mm-hmm . I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it <disfmarker> at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really <vocalsound> beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden <disfmarker> stan standard T_V_ so the place <disfmarker> uh remote the but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , We we're doing alright for time . and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? Yeah . Sorry that kinda cut into you there . No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um <disfmarker> Right . I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people <vocalsound> how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do <vocalsound> to use all these functions . Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna <disfmarker> you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . Mm . I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . Is that <disfmarker> I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh <disfmarker> for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think <vocalsound> you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? Maybe five percent , you know , Yeah mm . Mm . But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . and how much <disfmarker> I'm not the boss <vocalsound> . Okay . Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . <vocalsound> You know sell uh <disfmarker> things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh <vocalsound> um voice-activated . I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> Okay . 'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated Mm-hmm . I think of of <vocalsound> how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something Mm-hmm . And it's only for televisions . So we <disfmarker> everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their <vocalsound> their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . And so to me we have to make this a really special product Yeah . I'm <disfmarker> I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . Hmm . But we th that should be design . Yeah . That should be the design basically . Right . I think technology we'd we <disfmarker> we're not in the price range to do it . We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . Okay . Have to do <disfmarker> you have to do it in the box ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay well , so so that's up to you then to <vocalsound> to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . I have a question uh for you . Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or <disfmarker> I don't <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think all these things are pretty standard . I think we'll be okay .
'Kay . Cheers . Onto participant <vocalsound> four . Well <vocalsound> you know for marketing f <vocalsound> marketing for me is uh <disfmarker> Yeah , what for me is it um <disfmarker> I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a <disfmarker> we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . Mm-hmm . That's what we decided here . Um so what I did is I I decided that <vocalsound> that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . Mm-hmm . Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some <disfmarker> I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts . Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . So to me it's about selling d uh our identity <disfmarker> our corporate identity along with the product . <vocalsound> Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . Mm-hmm . Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for <disfmarker> I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . If if we could have a technological something <disfmarker>
it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . And you could page the remote if you lose it . Maybe there's a button on the cradle . Yep , that's right . I really see Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? But the cost i No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . There's uh <disfmarker> I mean I don't see it anyway . We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh <vocalsound> Can we dl can we do that without <vocalsound> uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys . I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> my reaction is no , but Well <vocalsound> what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs Mm-hmm . I like it . I like the idea , No , and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . It <disfmarker> i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , Right . and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . So it's very good for some people but it's not a like <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well it lasts <disfmarker> it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . Yeah I d I d I d I think it it <disfmarker> in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . Mm . But I I don't know , that's just my opinion . Well , I think again it's it <disfmarker> we have a cost issue here . You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . just <vocalsound> to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really <vocalsound> <disfmarker> un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like <disfmarker> for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . Yeah . Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all True . you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . Yeah . The locator'll definitely be more expensive . Mm-hmm . Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . Right . I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . Okay . Mm p please . And it's kind of <vocalsound> along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . Mm . Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries <disfmarker> throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ? <vocalsound> Solar . <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> s for some people <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well maybe not a solar remote But solar <disfmarker> but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get <disfmarker> go through the <disfmarker> go through <vocalsound> uh all these different batteries . And also you can <disfmarker> I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design <disfmarker> or for <disfmarker> not just for the user design , but also for the <disfmarker> just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , <vocalsound> a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . <vocalsound> Blah , I like it . I like the idea , but we're talking about <disfmarker> in cost is gonna probably double . It w it would increase the cost .
and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be <disfmarker> Well , see I I <disfmarker> see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . I just don't have enough money right now . I just don't know about that , because in order to do that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um <disfmarker> Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . <vocalsound> But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . <vocalsound> Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . They say they say okay here you go . They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , Mm-hmm . and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . Mm-hmm . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I don't know what kind of role we have in this <disfmarker> in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your <disfmarker> here's our ideas , okay . you know we like this idea , this idea no , but <vocalsound> to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not <disfmarker> I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . Mm . I don I I d I have to disagree though . I think our market niche is basically people who need <vocalsound> <disfmarker> who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . It does what they need . And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh <vocalsound> for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . Right . No I understand that . So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s <vocalsound> T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . Yeah y y you you wouldn't <disfmarker> That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . The interface will be different . If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , I see . because who wants just a television remote ? Mm sorry . I don't . <vocalsound> We he well here's my thing about that . If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . If it can't control <disfmarker> if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just <disfmarker> you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . I I I have a tendency to agree with you . I really do . So we really can't chase that . That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . So I think what we <disfmarker> So that's what I'm saying <disfmarker> We're really looking for something basic . The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're selling more than just the product . We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . <vocalsound> And and we're gonna make it <disfmarker> we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , <vocalsound> and solid . So if we can make <disfmarker> if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely <vocalsound> big thing . Mm-hmm . I think that's big . W <vocalsound> okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make <disfmarker> go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . Good design . We only have a few minutes left . But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? <vocalsound> and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me <vocalsound> , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . Yeah . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . Or my d <vocalsound> And I can communicate this to to the more senior <vocalsound> uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? <vocalsound> So what do we think maybe we should <disfmarker> Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . W <vocalsound> a question I have in in a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . Really need to wrap up now . Can can can we have multiple designs ? Have a modern , have a traditional , have a <disfmarker> you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or <disfmarker> Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So <disfmarker> Um but what we could do is some kind of <vocalsound> well I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel <vocalsound> <disfmarker> it has to feel good in your hand , Yeah . it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low . Yeah . What ab what ab <disfmarker> what about a a remote that's <vocalsound> that <vocalsound> doesn't maybe look like a remote ? Just an idea . They're selling these things everywhere . Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone . Or what if it looks like a pen ? Doesn't matter , yeah . Mm . Yeah . I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . I give you ideas , you guys create the product . Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . Don't worry about it . Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . Mm-hmm . One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Who's lost or broken their their remote . So <vocalsound> how many remotes do they wanna buy ? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? Exactly . Mm . Yeah . And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? Mm-hmm . The last remote you'll ever buy . And also presumably they've <disfmarker> And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . Well if if we're going down that then we can <disfmarker> we don't need to go the <disfmarker>
But I t I think what the <vocalsound> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . Mm-hmm . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um <disfmarker> Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . <vocalsound> Sorry that kinda cut into you there . Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . Yeah . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , Yeah . No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas .
but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . I like the idea , Blah , I like it . it would last for several hours on its own power , but we're talking about <disfmarker> in cost is gonna probably double . It w it would increase the cost . Yeah
Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als
Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . Yeah . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , Yeah . I just I I <disfmarker> Yeah , and neither do I in fact . So does anyone have any overall <gap> Well <vocalsound> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <vocalsound> no teletext , people are very comfortable <vocalsound> with <vocalsound> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not <disfmarker> we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . Mm . but I'm not a tech-mind either . I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . Yeah . Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . Yeah . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . Or my d <vocalsound> I just don't know about that , because in order to do that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um <disfmarker> Nah , but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . Yeah yeah . So we're quite fixed . Yep . I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . <vocalsound> we not design the T_V_ . Hmm . So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we <disfmarker> people use our remote with . Yeah . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I think we take with you . So it's kind of a stupid decision . But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . I don't know what kind of role we have in this <disfmarker> in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your <disfmarker> here's our ideas , okay . you know we like this idea , this idea no , but <vocalsound> to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not <disfmarker> I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . Mm . And I can communicate this to to the more senior <vocalsound> uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but <vocalsound> um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , but um we should go for the <disfmarker> But I t I think what the <vocalsound> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . Mm-hmm . What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . The interface will be different . and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . I think I ha If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , I see . because who wants just a television remote ? Mm sorry .
Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the <disfmarker> The first one <vocalsound> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , 'Kay . so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the <disfmarker> of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . Okay . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um <vocalsound> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say <disfmarker> 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . Uh something <disfmarker> Yeah , Mm yeah . I mean do they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that
and then others that are concealed . Something like that . G go on ahead . <vocalsound> <gap> so this is the technical functions design . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Right <gap> to do the um <vocalsound> the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . Mm-hmm . Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um <vocalsound> your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . <vocalsound> Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um <gap> sh show you now . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> here um the button there and there . <vocalsound> Alright <gap> . This one's prog . Sorry . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um <vocalsound> it's the same size as the the hard to use one . Oop . <vocalsound> Uh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for <gap> buttons . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . <vocalsound> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha <gap> from the bottom of it . So , <vocalsound> now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh <disfmarker> Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . <vocalsound> Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . Okay . Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? Larger ? Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out And others that are uh also available
and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , Mm-hmm . so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um , <vocalsound> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Mm-hmm . Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . Okay . Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Which was that ? um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um <disfmarker> Up <disfmarker> the numbers , or the up down ? God , I wou I would say that's required , <vocalsound> I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , Yeah . don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , We don't ? No ? you know like brightness and contrast ? Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Mm . I think <disfmarker> are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have Mm-hmm . um and after that we can add things if they're possible . Okay , right . Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and <disfmarker> There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . Right okay . Um <disfmarker> Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Mm-hmm yeah . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Oka Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , Mm-hmm . things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Yeah . Sure . Well I think it's a valid point . I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated ,
So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So these are people who are gadgety , right ? People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Um okay , so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition If we can . if we can . I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , Yeah . Yeah . Okay . because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Why is that ? You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . Right . Okay . Could it be an on off thing ? Um , Like if you want it on <disfmarker> Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . Yeah . anyway it's a <disfmarker> it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . Uh-huh . Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Not <disfmarker> Um . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they <disfmarker> they're saying oh it's <disfmarker> I lose it in the couch . Mm-hmm . that they <disfmarker> I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . <vocalsound> Oh really , you've seen one before . <vocalsound> Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . Sorry , Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh <vocalsound> the things . Oh , like overlap between what you said ? Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been <disfmarker> Mm hard to know what <disfmarker> where your role ends , yeah . So how do I how do I get this up ? Okay . Just um <disfmarker> Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's <disfmarker> now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could <disfmarker> and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about <disfmarker> try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um <vocalsound> the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Mm-hmm . Okay I'm gonna <disfmarker> we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't <disfmarker> doesn't really appeal to them . Mm-hmm . So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like <disfmarker> if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , <vocalsound> frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . Repetitive strain injury . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um . <vocalsound> And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be <disfmarker> wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . Mm-hmm . Um people <vocalsound> uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . Okay . but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . Mm . So it <disfmarker> you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um <disfmarker> But I <disfmarker> I'm <disfmarker> my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Mm-hmm . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , Okay . Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um <disfmarker> who's our our target audience , our target market . That's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? Okay . I mean <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Where's the money , maybe . Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Yeah . Mm . But you want <disfmarker> it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , Mm-hmm . So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? <vocalsound> It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . Is that too <disfmarker> is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? Yeah , okay . Right . Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Okay . Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? Yep . Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Um <disfmarker> Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ? Yep . Uh f It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , N yeah . in terms of <disfmarker> I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want Okay . and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . Yeah . Just kind of young professionals , uh th like <vocalsound> if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . Mm-hmm . So we could say that was our target . I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . Yeah .
um . Okay . Um . Right . Well this is just the working design um . Mm-hmm . Well this is just what <disfmarker> how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're <disfmarker> we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like <disfmarker> Besides the basics , I think back <disfmarker> in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Mm-hmm . so I don't think um there's a need for that . Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , Mm-hmm . from a <disfmarker> from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . Mm-hmm . Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that <disfmarker> you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um <vocalsound> Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . Hmm . You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic <disfmarker> a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , Mm-hmm . like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . So it's not really a constraint in that sense , Um so I guess the rest of it <disfmarker> I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? 'Kay . Uh . Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? Sure . Sure . Yeah , w I'm done . Are you are you all done ? Yep . Mm . Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , Okay . And like on the <disfmarker> means <disfmarker> b I guess this would be <disfmarker> Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like <disfmarker> what are our options ? Yep . Alright , what's what i in <disfmarker> Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . Right . This is just um The basic principle of <disfmarker> a basic principles and basic components that are needed . Okay . Yep . Yep . Okay . So each component represents one function , Mm-hmm . but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , Mm-hmm . and the power are things that you won't have to care about . Mm-hmm . Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? Okay . Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . Okay . Right . Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it Yep . um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . Mm-hmm Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . Mm . And um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? There's there's not much specific specific information , W Because infra-red is something which everybody has . W Well well we've um <disfmarker> In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , <vocalsound> Something I was wondering about was the power . Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? There's a there's <disfmarker> Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , Uh-huh . and you add cost to it , Uh-huh . um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . <vocalsound> Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . Okay , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , Yeah . then I don't think rechargeable is something we should <disfmarker> you know , we really need to care about . Yeah . Okay , so just stick to to regular <disfmarker> Um .
Um , right . So basically the um <disfmarker> I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , <vocalsound> So um just to recap on <disfmarker> Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Yeah , that's good . Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? Um . <vocalsound> I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . Okay , right . Ta . And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? Okay , I think R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under <disfmarker> like sort of under a door or some <disfmarker> Yeah , it's as optional functions . Yeah . 'Cause what what I'm <disfmarker> I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . I dunno if that'd be a problem . Okay . <vocalsound> Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Mm-hmm . Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . Yeah . Okay . One would be audio controls , Mm-hmm . one would be video controls , Okay . and the other one would be a device . Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . Yeah . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , Right . like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , Yeah . and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 'Kay , okay . Like that . Okay , right . Mm okay , great . Um , okay well just <disfmarker> I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . Uh-huh . so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . Okay . Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . Okay , We put it out . so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume <disfmarker> hi Mm-hmm . Okay , Mm-hmm . And then video is anything that you can see . and then visual <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , Um . stuff like that . Okay , um <disfmarker> And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , <vocalsound> because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . Mm-hmm . Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , Mm-hmm .
Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next <disfmarker> well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , Mm-hmm . um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . <vocalsound>
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . <vocalsound> Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface ,
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface ,
and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the <disfmarker> The first one <vocalsound> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , 'Kay . so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the <disfmarker> of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else .
so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the <disfmarker> of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . Okay . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
Um , <vocalsound> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Mm-hmm . I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . Okay . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . Okay , right . Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and <disfmarker> There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . Right okay .
Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like <disfmarker> if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
So um just to recap on <disfmarker> Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Yeah , that's good . Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . Yeah .
and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha There might be one other problem with the transmission ,
like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , Yeah . then I don't think rechargeable is something we should <disfmarker> you know , we really need to care about . Yeah . Okay , so just stick to to regular <disfmarker> Um .
but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . Mm . So it <disfmarker> you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . just <disfmarker> I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . Uh-huh . you know like brightness and contrast ? Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Mm . so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . I think <disfmarker> are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have Mm-hmm . um and after that we can add things if they're possible . Okay , right . Okay . Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . Okay , We put it out . so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume <disfmarker> hi Mm-hmm . Okay , Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Mm-hmm yeah . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Oka Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , Mm-hmm . things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available <vocalsound> and then others that are concealed . Something like that . Mm-hmm . And then video is anything that you can see . and then visual <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , I dunno if that'd be a problem . Okay . <vocalsound> Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Mm-hmm . Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . Yeah . Okay . One would be audio controls , Mm-hmm . one would be video controls , Okay . and the other one would be a device . Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , Um . um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . Yeah . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , Right . like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , Yeah . and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 'Kay , okay . Like that . Okay , right . Mm okay , great . Um , okay well
but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . Mm . So it <disfmarker> you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Mm-hmm yeah . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Oka Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , Mm-hmm . things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available <vocalsound> and then others that are concealed . Something like that . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . <vocalsound> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha <gap> from the bottom of it .
So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So these are people who are gadgety , right ? People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um <disfmarker> who's our our target audience , our target market . That's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? Okay . I mean <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Where's the money , maybe . Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Yeah . Mm . But you want <disfmarker> it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , Mm-hmm . So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? okay . Right . Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Okay . Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? Yep . Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . N yeah . in terms of <disfmarker> I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well Yeah .
Sorry , So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Um okay , so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition If we can . if we can . I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , Yeah . Yeah . Okay . because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Why is that ? You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . Right . Okay . Could it be an on off thing ? Um , Like if you want it on <disfmarker> Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . Yeah . anyway it's a <disfmarker> it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . Uh-huh . Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Not <disfmarker> Um . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they <disfmarker> they're saying oh it's <disfmarker> I lose it in the couch . Mm-hmm . that they <disfmarker> I reckon one problem with speech recognition is <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Um <disfmarker> Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ? um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . Yep . Uh f It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , N yeah . <vocalsound> Oh really , you've seen one before . to say let's target these people and give them what they want Okay . and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . Yeah . <vocalsound> Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . Just kind of young professionals , uh th like <vocalsound> if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . Mm-hmm . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um .
For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Oka Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , Mm-hmm . Yeah . 'Cause what what I'm <disfmarker> I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . Something like that . I dunno if that'd be a problem . Okay , I think R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under <disfmarker> like sort of under a door or some <disfmarker> Yeah , it's as optional functions . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . <vocalsound> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha <gap> from the bottom of it .
And that's uh fifteen twenty five . Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe . <gap> . Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype . Okay , it's a <disfmarker> Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , <vocalsound> <gap> I think if we both step up but <disfmarker> and uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do <disfmarker> uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit Okay . <gap> ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh <vocalsound> with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain <gap> ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down . I'm afraid yeah . We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on . <gap> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . <vocalsound> So . Any further comments ? Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , the uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . Mm . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have <gap> the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh <vocalsound> of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .
I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , Mm . Sure . Mm . And making it a bright colour helps with the <disfmarker> So we still have that noise thing , yeah ? Mm-hmm . Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding <gap> finding it once it's lost ? I'd say number one . Number one ? Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker <gap> . Mm-hmm . just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is You wanna say something ? um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna <disfmarker> Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? Um , a few . <vocalsound> Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said . So . and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ Um . Uh evaluation . <vocalsound> Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . <vocalsound> Um then we will <disfmarker> it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria <gap> based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means <vocalsound> that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . <vocalsound> One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still <disfmarker> the locator , is that still <disfmarker> Yeah , that's still part of the design . Sure .
and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , <gap> require more buttons , etcetera . Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um . Different languages ? That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h <vocalsound> is have it um circular and have it s <vocalsound> so that the uh the pink <gap> actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um . Mm . Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? Um b b b da is <disfmarker> you mean on the plastic , or ? <gap> . Let's have a look . You now have as much information as I do . <vocalsound> Um . Yeah , yeah . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . Yeah . So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . We don't even have uh speakers here . like uh we uh <disfmarker> what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? Mm . Uh no , we haven't , not <disfmarker> Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . <vocalsound> That'll <gap> it literally would just be a button . Yeah . That's too expensive <gap> We might have to <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves the remote . But that's what makes it uh original though , isn't it ? Mm . I think <gap> if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a shame . We should possibly have <disfmarker> If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . Does this does this bear in mind that <disfmarker> Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . Mm . Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm <disfmarker> we're gonna have to stick with these figures . 'Kay . So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , <vocalsound> I think so . despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm . Um yeah <gap> I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean <vocalsound> keep the um the articulation ? It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , This is what I'm wondering . yeah , it can still be single curved , but <disfmarker> Single curved with articulation ? Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we <disfmarker> my bad . We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . Mm . Oh , wait a minute . Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . Costs four . Yeah . But I thought it was just completely pointless . You got a email about voice response ? Alright . B i basically it was <gap> saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , battery definitely , <disfmarker> So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca <vocalsound> locator thing . It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um . It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . One <disfmarker> point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um . l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case So Right . I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , Yellow . <vocalsound> it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . Yeah .
It's not and we can see <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sure . we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us <vocalsound> So uh <vocalsound> Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time .
Ten . 'Kay . Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . Um . Okay . Three ? Mm . Three if we're being generous , I feel . Three . I think we can do three . <vocalsound> Reduce the number of unused buttons . We're down to t two buttons , Totally . Yeah . I'd say we're doing well there . Okay , that was good . Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus <gap> that's 'Kay that's <disfmarker> we're not doing so badly . Um <vocalsound> easy to use <disfmarker> oh okay , let's forget that one . Fancy looking . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> As he models the <disfmarker> It doesn't get much fancier . Sure . that's m that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . Technologically innovative . Well , we're getting rid of the locator thing which which Which is a shame . yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm . I'd give it a three for this <disfmarker> for that . No need for teletext . <gap> . Yeah . I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , 'Kay . We'll get panned on the next one , anyway . <vocalsound> Materials that people find pleasing . Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . Yeah , Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . Yeah . Plastic , it sucks . But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . It's not a step backwards . <gap> five ? Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . Six ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , that's totally thrown everything off balance . Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . W we could . Put a leopard print on it . <vocalsound> Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . <vocalsound> I know , Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype but <disfmarker> 'cause we had yellow . If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . Leopard print would be cool . But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , <disfmarker> Yeah Like yellow , yeah . It would also help keep the the product placement Logo , brand . But <disfmarker> Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . Is it inspired by <gap> clothing fashion ? Is this like a banana type colour ? <vocalsound> Yes . Could we stretch <disfmarker> no still , it's not shaped like a banana is <disfmarker> It's kind o it What is <disfmarker> what fruit or veg is flat ? I I think s I I think this isn't <disfmarker> not particularly fruit and veggie . Um . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , <vocalsound> what , four ? Oh that's it's very ambitious , Is that being too generous ? Mm . I'd <vocalsound> I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . <vocalsound> Is the sole criterion for being um fashion <gap> fashionable or inspired by current fashions . yeah , um . it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like . Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . Is that <vocalsound> sound reasonable ? Am I <disfmarker> Yeah , I'll go with five . do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ?
'S bad design , that thing . <vocalsound> it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive <disfmarker> you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . Which gives us an average of three . It's <disfmarker> this would be in the middle . So we it's it's not bad . It's in the good section . it was okay . It was good . that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? Well ,
don't know how lo much longer we've got . At least five minutes I think . Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . So , we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? For example um <disfmarker> we'll work backwards I suppose . The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . Um <gap> people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? I would say <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . but not <gap> . I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . I think tracking . Well I think this is a <disfmarker> I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this . It's all p goes into their corpus . Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um It must <disfmarker> transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . Yeah , that woulda been pretty good . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno . How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? Good . <gap> . I'd <disfmarker> yeah I liked it , yeah . Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing . Very good . I li yeah , top marks . Um last one we've got is room for creativity . <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> Now , <vocalsound> Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , I think we got <disfmarker> <gap> squish . We're burs bursting with creativity . yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's <disfmarker> that was not the problem . I think of <disfmarker> in the end , ideas that can be used <gap> sadly <gap> . Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . Mm-hmm . It's a bit of a pity . Um I would have to agree on that . I think we needed a larger budget . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . I mean I th <vocalsound> I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh first on the market . <vocalsound> So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such . Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more <disfmarker> Yeah , to begin with . In the beginning , yeah . I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . <vocalsound> Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um <gap> anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report . Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . Thank you . Thank you . <vocalsound> I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing .
So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . 'Kay . So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , <vocalsound> That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ .
my bad . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , Mm . so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . Any further comments ? Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .
So it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like . l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case
Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on . <gap> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .

Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . yeah , it can still be single curved , but <disfmarker>
still failing ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . No . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes . Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So and what you're gonna talk about . <vocalsound> 'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So <disfmarker> Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So Mm . some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the <disfmarker> This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um <disfmarker> Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . They won't spend their money very easily . So <disfmarker> Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um <disfmarker> The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality <disfmarker> As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most
but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . Okay . and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs
<vocalsound> Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and <gap> not much information about it , <gap> <disfmarker> Um about uh interface but uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um <disfmarker> But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah . In one um remote control . One remote . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . Um few uh buttons <vocalsound> but uh <disfmarker> This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um <disfmarker> Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um <disfmarker> My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um <disfmarker> and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh <vocalsound> I dunno um <disfmarker> And um here you've got a s kind of a display . It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh <gap> . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . So uh a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so <disfmarker> Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . <gap> N I I don't think so . Yeah . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Touchscreen . 'Kay . That's nice . Uh <disfmarker> Well it would certainly make a fancy design . Yeah . Yeah . But the <disfmarker> It wouldn't be very robust . So <disfmarker>
Okay . <vocalsound> Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it . and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up <vocalsound> and uh tell you some new uh requirements . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because <vocalsound> uh it will be too complex Okay . and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . Mm . So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . Um internet is also mentioned <gap> in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well .
And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . Mm . And besides that it's um <disfmarker> If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . That's right . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . Mm-hmm . Or there don't have to be a lot . But I don't think <disfmarker> I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , I think it's very important in the in the design . You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with <disfmarker> Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . <vocalsound> Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and <disfmarker> But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . 'Cause it can be <disfmarker> No . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible No . <vocalsound> So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? I think so . Yeah . Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . Yeah that was what I suggested . Yeah . Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . You have it on <disfmarker> Yeah Hm . you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . Yeah . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . Yeah . So No . <gap> Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , Y i because <disfmarker> um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause It will be too much as well . <gap> I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does . Yeah . And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , Based . Okay . Yeah . but <disfmarker> Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen . Just a small screen That's a good idea . with two <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . Mm . Yeah . Uh what do we want ? I think <disfmarker> If we want um a <gap> with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . I think that would be a <disfmarker> So that's the <disfmarker> If we're able to really bring an innovative product . <gap> Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . Yeah the really <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . But I'd have to look into that a little more . Sixty . 'Kay . Small warning . And with uh the little screen in it , <gap> which explains the buttons . You could <disfmarker> I think we n it would be a lot easier to Should <disfmarker> adapt it to different cultures . Yeah . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah . So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? <vocalsound> Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . <vocalsound> But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . Yeah . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . I'm pretty much against it . Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's <disfmarker> I think we're just gonna go for another <gap> forty <disfmarker> Yeah it's it is <disfmarker> Standard remote . pretty I think we can I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons remote control . which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . Yeah . And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . Yes They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . <vocalsound> But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think <gap> <disfmarker> the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So Mm . Yeah . I think that if we're <disfmarker> If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um <disfmarker> I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? So <disfmarker> It's a big success . Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . I haven't heard of it . Uh . I think so as well . Mm . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . Or is teletext a <disfmarker> But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . Yeah . So I suggest uh <disfmarker> I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . It's <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Is anybody um really against teletext ? No . No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , Functionality should be few buttons , you said . Yes . I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . Yeah . But do you need <disfmarker> I think if you if you only l So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Nah . Maybe c we can <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ? Mm . There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or <disfmarker> Yeah . That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast .
Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . <vocalsound> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept ,
I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . <vocalsound> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . So
<vocalsound> Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because <vocalsound> uh it will be too complex
Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . Mm . Yeah . If we're able to really bring an innovative product . <gap> Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . Yeah the really <disfmarker> Uh let's um specify the target group .
so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well ,
Um <vocalsound> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Kay .
Um <vocalsound> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Kay .
Um <vocalsound> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Kay . and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it .
So that's the <disfmarker> If we're able to really bring an innovative product . <gap> Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it .

'Kay . Small warning . And with uh the little screen in it , <gap> which explains the buttons . You could <disfmarker> I think we n it would be a lot easier to Should <disfmarker> adapt it to different cultures . Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .
Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . <gap> N I I don't think so . Yeah . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Touchscreen . <gap> Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , Y i because <disfmarker> um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause
so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem .

And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . Yes
So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Nah . Maybe c we can <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . Or there don't have to be a lot .

It's a big success . Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . I haven't heard of it . Uh let's um specify the target group .

I think that would be a <disfmarker> If we're able to really bring an innovative product . <gap> Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . Yeah the really <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . But I'd have to look into that a little more . Sixty .
Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the <disfmarker> in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's <disfmarker> the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's <disfmarker> we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . <vocalsound> Right .
we've got forty minutes . Right s <vocalsound> so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , <vocalsound> You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . Mm-hmm . okay , so basically I'll start off by <disfmarker> uh <vocalsound> I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require Mm-hmm . and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to <disfmarker> connect that anyway <disfmarker> brief introduction to the insides of a remote control Yeah . this is the outside of the remote , right ? Mm-hmm . If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . Mm-hmm . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh <vocalsound> everything else is kind of <disfmarker> Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ Yeah . and uh on pressing this button I <disfmarker> a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . <vocalsound> So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , Right ? So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . Okay .
Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh <disfmarker> an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , Yeah , w energy source . so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? Mm-hmm . So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our <disfmarker> uh the cells , yeah ? Yeah . Uh thes these are the kind <disfmarker> different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um <vocalsound> yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> A wind-up remote . So uh I don't know if <disfmarker> even if you want to consider this , <vocalsound> since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . Mm-hmm . So <vocalsound> the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and <disfmarker> And charging their remote , Yeah , yeah . Yeah , rub off some of those . <vocalsound> So what was what was this k ka The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . Okay . Uh yeah . But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you <disfmarker> Yeah . But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also <vocalsound> made by the company . Yay . <vocalsound> Environment friendly . Okay <vocalsound> um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . Yeah <vocalsound> . There are different cases that can be provided . They can be <disfmarker> basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , Mm-hmm . they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with <disfmarker> on both the sides . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> These are the three options , right ? Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , Yeah , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Um the <disfmarker> so uh we can use even um <vocalsound> a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh <vocalsound> uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah ? Uh okay , the interface options now . So <vocalsound> we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . <vocalsound> Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh <disfmarker> Sony . Yeah . And splinters and stuff and <disfmarker> Yeah , Mm . <vocalsound> So , and they have <disfmarker> they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . Okay . Yeah . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um <vocalsound> in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . on the L_C_D_ we can , you know <vocalsound> <disfmarker> G yeah , Yeah , I would say buttons , Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Yeah . Banana's yellow , <vocalsound> yeah , definitely . Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons But it does not hold any advantages as such for a <disfmarker> Yeah , It's just a gimmick . Yeah , I think so . because of style and <disfmarker> Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . like not not symmet Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . <vocalsound> Yeah , but I mean y you have to <disfmarker> Yeah , we we have but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the <disfmarker> um with using <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> The various electronic options are um uh <vocalsound> so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh <disfmarker> so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one Mm-hmm . or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Mm-hmm . Um the <disfmarker> we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um <vocalsound> and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . Mm-hmm .
Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually <vocalsound> of the <disfmarker> of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least <disfmarker> uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Ugly . Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . Right , interface concept . Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the <disfmarker> this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . That's fine . So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I <vocalsound> I can just mention them aw again . Mm-hmm . Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which <disfmarker> uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . Mm-hmm . Um um the method I <vocalsound> employed this time was <vocalsound> a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and <vocalsound> also um <vocalsound> whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um <vocalsound> and then um <vocalsound> this uh this um <vocalsound> this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . Mm-hmm . So some findings um <vocalsound> um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um <vocalsound> okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here .
Mm-hmm . So some findings um <vocalsound> um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um <vocalsound> okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons .

And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Ugly . um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . <vocalsound> Our own company has developed a new in user interface <disfmarker> uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows <disfmarker> i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . It's <disfmarker> yeah . Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed <vocalsound> a new um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh programmable speech uh <vocalsound> mm sorry uh Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's <disfmarker> once once the mm <vocalsound> um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . Uh-huh , hi <vocalsound> yeah . So <vocalsound> I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . Mm . Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um <vocalsound> uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh <vocalsound> oh yeah are th No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> just a moment , I'll <vocalsound> I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um <vocalsound> it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . <vocalsound> Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . Look , this one here . it's like you press this or this or <disfmarker> Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh <disfmarker> It's like it's like where you <disfmarker> you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Right . Uh-huh . Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , Mm-hmm . but you've got a lot less control over it . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . Mm-hmm . It <vocalsound> it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh <vocalsound> if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is <vocalsound> uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .
Okay . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . Mm-hmm . Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . Mm-hmm . Okay . And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . So um <vocalsound> uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? So <disfmarker> if if you could put <disfmarker> <disfmarker> yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Yeah . Um and an And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning <disfmarker> yeah . so that means we need an advanced thing . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , Mm-hmm . Mm . and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? <vocalsound> Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote Mm . and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . Mm . Right . <gap> so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . Right . It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , You know ? Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . Yeah . But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , Right . like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . Mm . Mm-hmm . So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . Yeah . So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that Mm right . and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , And then you can flip it open . So yeah , that's uh that's it . Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . Mm-hmm . Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .
Go on . Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I discovered clip art . <vocalsound> Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? <vocalsound> Yeah , and possibly even uneven , Mm-hmm . like not not symmet Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . yeah . But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , Mm-hmm . because <disfmarker> I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands Right . so you wanna <disfmarker> you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . Mm-hmm .
yeah . Okay . So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go Yeah , I think so . because of style and <disfmarker> Yeah ,
Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh <disfmarker> an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . Yeah , yeah . To some degree . So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , Uh-huh . so um we could use <vocalsound> titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh <disfmarker> Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , Yeah , <vocalsound> Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Mm yeah . Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um <disfmarker> You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . Yeah . it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? Uh-huh . Besides , you have four sides to a thing , Yeah , 'cause the <disfmarker> so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Yeah . Right . and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? Right . Dunno . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um <vocalsound> according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is <disfmarker> are these three . Yeah . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . Nothing to <vocalsound> open them . Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . Right , yeah , yeah . But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Something a bit squishy and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , Yeah , we we have So it could be like a rubbery <disfmarker> we have rubber ,
Okay ? <vocalsound> Thanks Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Yeah . so um <vocalsound> hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> You you got a wind <gap> dynamo , yeah . Yeah uh-hum yeah . it's not <disfmarker> that's not streamlined and sexy , <vocalsound> having a having a wind up . Okay . Um <vocalsound> kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , I think tha but uh <vocalsound> It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? <vocalsound> it's <disfmarker> As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , I mean if <disfmarker> this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . <vocalsound> Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Kinetic energy it needs <disfmarker> I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , I'd I'd keep it on . Um <vocalsound> okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? <vocalsound> The wood thing . Mm . I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , Yeah , Yeah . and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's it's not <vocalsound> a practical <disfmarker> I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . Yeah . And splinters and stuff and <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh it seems to be <vocalsound> out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be <disfmarker> You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? Yeah , but you <disfmarker> um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? Mm-hmm . Yeah , so for channel numbers but <disfmarker> Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . But I th Just for fast <disfmarker> with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um <vocalsound> discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , <vocalsound> I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Mm right . It's it's the <disfmarker> I I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , So mm <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and <disfmarker> they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , Alright . Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I <vocalsound> yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it <vocalsound> it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , <vocalsound> E either or <disfmarker> it's uh <disfmarker> you can al include everything in the spinning if you Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . G yeah . so you have to decide whether <disfmarker> you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole <disfmarker> if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . Hmm . Mm um <disfmarker> But if you've got a <disfmarker> if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Ah , but I mean you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . Th <vocalsound> that would be on one side , uh-huh . I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . Yeah , I um I think so too , <vocalsound> Uh i it <disfmarker> No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . I mean the case would be <disfmarker> yeah You want an outside of rubber the case would be rubber and the the buttons , and then open it up and <disfmarker> rubber buttons , but then <disfmarker> Yeah . Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . Yeah . Or maybe like interchangeable cases . Mm-hmm . 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . Right , right . Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Right . So I'll rub that out . <vocalsound> And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than <disfmarker> Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or <disfmarker> Yeah I think we <disfmarker> um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or <disfmarker> I guess . That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . Yeah , does <disfmarker> Bananas . <vocalsound> Yeah . Banana's yellow , <vocalsound> yeah , definitely . Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote <vocalsound> the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple Green . Yeah . and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Um <vocalsound> okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We need the advanced <disfmarker> yeah . um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , Yeah . but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so <vocalsound> it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . Yeah . So I'll rub off the other two . Mm-hmm . So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or <disfmarker> That was the <disfmarker> We've got five more minutes . we'll have uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , Mm-hmm . a although it does seem uh interesting . Yeah . yeah . Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? Mm-hmm . It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so <disfmarker> Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , <vocalsound> Ye yeah , <vocalsound> Okay . Right . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . Flat on the top . Mm-hmm . Uh oh now I've gone too far . Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . <vocalsound> So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip Right . and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber Yep . and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside Yeah . On the <disfmarker> You've maybe got , you know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , Mm-hmm . and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , In the centre , yeah . Mm yeah . Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , Mm-hmm . which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . <vocalsound> Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so <disfmarker> in case we have to refer to it . Yeah .
Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , Mm-hmm .
Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . which I'll presume he'll work out what that means .

Yep . and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and <disfmarker> and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber
Yep . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . Flat on the top . Mm-hmm . But if you've got a <disfmarker> if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Ah , but I mean you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . it's no <disfmarker> it's not not vegetable . and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber
and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . but uh it seems to be <vocalsound> out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be <disfmarker> You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? Yeah , but Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Right . Okay ? <vocalsound> Thanks Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Yeah . um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , Yeah . but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so <vocalsound> it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . it's uh <disfmarker> you can al include everything in the spinning if you Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . G yeah .
Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote <vocalsound> the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple Green . That's our overall concept , <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and be in bright vegetable colours . Uh-huh .
I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so <disfmarker> Uh oh now I've gone too far . Yeah . <vocalsound> Ye yeah , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . <vocalsound> So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip
I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Mm right . Yeah , but you <disfmarker> um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? Mm-hmm .
Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . Everything fine ? That's nice . Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So
Doh . 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and <disfmarker> Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the <disfmarker> These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we <vocalsound> at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really <disfmarker> This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means .
or <disfmarker> A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um <disfmarker> Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um <disfmarker> See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . <vocalsound> So um <disfmarker> D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of <gap> looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the <disfmarker> So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> 'kay um yeah . <gap> uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh <disfmarker> I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and <disfmarker> Uh <gap> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um <disfmarker> It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off
Uh thank you . <vocalsound> Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced
<gap> Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . Usabili Supplements . That's okay . See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh <disfmarker> For lefties Can't we make uh <disfmarker> Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel Yeah . That is true . So um it's <disfmarker> I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . Yeah . I could draw them out . just <disfmarker> Let's look at the flat case . Oh . Mm-hmm . Yeah . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . So this type should be better for you or better <disfmarker> Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . Easier ? Mm . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . <gap> Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . <vocalsound> Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um <disfmarker> Yeah . So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh get your mouse . Yeah . And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh <disfmarker> Yeah . That's a good one . Yeah . Yeah . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . <vocalsound> Uh rem And then h the rest of the buttons over here . Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh <disfmarker> Yeah still here Thank you . So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm . Yeah . 'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . <gap> Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Yeah . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's <vocalsound> really an option . <vocalsound> Okay <gap> . <vocalsound> Where's my mouse ? Then <disfmarker> We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now Yeah . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light Mm . so it's not a very good option . No . Or the kinetic energy . Yeah . Okay . And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? Well You just <disfmarker> y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . You use it and it works . Nah . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's true . And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . Oh . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . Yeah . you could load up the batteries , B b you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so <disfmarker> Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . That's true . <vocalsound> And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . Okay . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . Mm-hmm . Yeah . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . Okay . And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . Yeah . Uh . That's safe . I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? Yeah . That's a good point . Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . No . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control Mm . I would greatly advise not to do it . Yeah . Yeah . younger people . But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 'Kay . It's a bit higher percentage , but <disfmarker> Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . Yeah . Yeah . And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . Okay . Yeah . I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , No . And um yeah I think the um <disfmarker> Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . Yeah . So <disfmarker> And that's the best choice . Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . Just the advanced . 'Kay . <gap> , advanced chip . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not <disfmarker> Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Mm-hmm . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Well Uh I dunno . <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , wood-coloured . Mm . But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? Mm I dunno . You don't know ? I'll have to uh research . I think so Probably . Mm . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh <disfmarker> Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . Yeah . maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh <disfmarker> You can sell the cases . Yeah . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well Yeah that is true . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . Yeah . Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . Costs . 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um Remote . one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . Yeah . So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? Yes . I think that's a good uh good option . Yeah . Changing case covers . Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Yes . Could you explain that a little more ? Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . Mm-hmm . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . And what would single curved and double curved mean ? Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So Uh but the form has to be um <disfmarker> It has to <disfmarker> It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? No just to lie down . <gap> okay . That's <disfmarker> And I'd prefer the corners to be round . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the Yeah . Does somebody have ideas for a form or Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um <disfmarker> Yeah . Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily <disfmarker> Yeah . So that would be great for that . <gap> Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . For uh <disfmarker> Uh for <disfmarker> For left-handed users also . Yeah yeah . Yeah we Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh <vocalsound> uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? For the volume .
So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story .
It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one .
The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .
So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . And that's the best choice . Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .
So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . And that's the best choice . Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .
So it's gotta be advanced . Okay Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . Well because we're using the the the the display . Just the advanced .
Mm . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh Yeah . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? Yes . I think that's a good uh good option . Yeah .
Mm . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in .
Uh so <disfmarker> Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . That's true . <vocalsound> And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . Okay . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . Yeah .

So <disfmarker> And that's the best choice . Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . Nah . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's true . And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . Oh . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . Yeah . you could load up the batteries , B b you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough .
Yeah . I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , No .
Yeah . younger people . But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 'Kay . It's a bit higher percentage , but <disfmarker> Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it .

I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , No . And um yeah I think the um <disfmarker> Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly .
Mm . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?

But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? Mm I dunno . You don't know ? I'll have to uh research . I think so Probably .
All hooked up . <vocalsound> Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um <vocalsound> hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . Yep . I'll do that next time . Um <vocalsound> I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent Yeah , the last minute , yeah , at the last minute , yeah . Yeah . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control <disfmarker> that's the So I would say <disfmarker> You said uh targ target groups , yeah ? what does that mean ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , Uh okay , 'kay . So are <disfmarker> So we need to <disfmarker> yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Okay . <vocalsound> Right . Um <vocalsound> so f from the <disfmarker> Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we <disfmarker> you don't have to do it now but when <disfmarker> once you go back , Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . Right sure . just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . Uh okay . <vocalsound>
Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um so <vocalsound> i in my personal preferences um <vocalsound> I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um <vocalsound> uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . <vocalsound> That's about it . <vocalsound> So anything that you would like to know or <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? <vocalsound> No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . <vocalsound> Br Um yeah . Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . Yeah . So so tha yeah , <vocalsound> we definitely need to operate within our constraints , Yeah . just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . Uh okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So n uh with uh with regard to the <vocalsound> uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um <vocalsound> a few basic uh components of the remote and uh <vocalsound> se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um <vocalsound> in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and <vocalsound> uh from the user interface person . Hmm . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . <vocalsound> Okay , so <vocalsound> these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um <vocalsound> so basically uh the <disfmarker> as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <vocalsound> and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um <vocalsound> okay , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the <vocalsound> the use for television , <vocalsound> in order to keep things simple . Um <vocalsound> also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it <disfmarker> so <vocalsound> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . <vocalsound> Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um <vocalsound> there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so <vocalsound> I'll basic go over to the <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates <disfmarker> uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . <vocalsound> So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then <disfmarker> so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated <vocalsound> to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .
'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <vocalsound> functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then <vocalsound> there are <disfmarker> surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and then um <vocalsound> the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um <vocalsound> could be just <disfmarker> uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <vocalsound> done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . Mm-hmm . If <disfmarker> I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for <disfmarker> that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . Yeah , and also it's it's um <disfmarker> other question is uh because there are so many different <disfmarker> And there are so many different things that could possibly be included <vocalsound> because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , Mm-hmm . so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . Yeah . Okay , so do you want to <disfmarker> Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue <disfmarker> Yes , Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some <vocalsound> some first issues that came up . Mm-hmm . Um uh my method was um to look at um other <vocalsound> um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . <vocalsound> And yeah , and then just to um <vocalsound> put the main function of the remote control in in words . Mm-hmm . Um so the findings uh were <vocalsound> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm <vocalsound> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um <vocalsound> okay , that's great .
and then um <vocalsound> the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um <vocalsound> could be just <disfmarker> uh there could be a menu button Um so the findings uh were <vocalsound> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm <vocalsound> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um <vocalsound> and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <vocalsound> done through the menu . And yeah ,
Mm-hmm . So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? <vocalsound> So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um <vocalsound> so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or <disfmarker> I mean in <disfmarker> we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? Right . A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user Yeah , and it'll make the costs <disfmarker> yeah . and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . Right . Mm-hmm . I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . Mm . So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um <disfmarker> because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . Mm-hmm .
Excellent . Cool , okay . So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . <vocalsound> Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <vocalsound> Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . <vocalsound> Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but <disfmarker> It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , <vocalsound> Mm . so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , Right . Mm . they just make it look ugly . Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing . Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . Mm-hmm . Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . Okay . What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? <vocalsound> Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses Mm-hmm . and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , Mm-hmm . so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages <disfmarker> Right . you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ <vocalsound> . That's alright . Um okay , but that shows how people <disfmarker> whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite <disfmarker> are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking Mm . and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Right . Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . <vocalsound> So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Mm . Mm . Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Um and then like a locator , <vocalsound> so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or <disfmarker> not a mobile phone <disfmarker> Mm . Some kind of a ring , Keys and things like that , Yeah , that's it , you know . yeah . Whistle and it <vocalsound> screams at you , yeah . I know , it's weird . <vocalsound> So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something <vocalsound> <disfmarker>
Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . <vocalsound> So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ?

Yeah . I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . Yeah . Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , Yeah . because actually I mean they're all still re young people . Is not a massive difference , you know . Yeah . Um . I'm just gonna tick yes . So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss Mm . <vocalsound> I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um <vocalsound> uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um <vocalsound> uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . Cat's . Ca <vocalsound> . So if we need to have a target group um then uh <vocalsound> I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Right . but I'm assuming , you know , yes . Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Yeah . Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket Right , and the <disfmarker> I don't know how often they're buying televisions . and <disfmarker> but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah . Yeah , I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and <disfmarker> you share a television or something that <disfmarker> yeah . wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was <disfmarker> Seventy six point three percent . It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , Yeah . but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like <disfmarker> I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , <vocalsound> but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . No , No , do totally . Yeah this this is not <vocalsound> unaffordable , <gap> but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ <vocalsound> to use its full <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , yeah . The s the stu and be a bit strange to have a fancy <vocalsound> rome remote . yeah , and the remote control might not
but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . Yeah . Is that gonna have a <disfmarker> an implication for the technical specs ? Um <vocalsound> I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? I don't know . Yeah . With um <disfmarker> but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , An louder , S so <disfmarker> tha that should be relatively simple . Right . Okay . y you'd maybe need a code word . O <vocalsound> but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Right . Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . <disfmarker> yeah . I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , Mm . Mm . What wh uh <vocalsound> what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with <disfmarker> away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , <vocalsound> that would be another way to do it . So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . some kind of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But that's definitely a possibility . Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't <vocalsound> as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it Mm . Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . yeah . It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <vocalsound> and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm Mm . yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . being cl I mean it'll it'll <disfmarker> mm . No , but I I I was just defending the <vocalsound> the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . So uh <vocalsound> wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , Mm-hmm . so we we can probably come to know where it is . That's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um <vocalsound> specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option The major ones , yeah . Mm-hmm . Right . um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <vocalsound> Okay . What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break <gap> Mm-hmm . and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . So where exactly is this i Okay , cool . Um <vocalsound> as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . Right . <vocalsound> I guess I'll find out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'll be looking <vocalsound> you'll be looking at the user interface concept , <vocalsound> Uh something conceptual , yeah . on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that <disfmarker> okay , yeah , that's good . so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . Okay .
um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <vocalsound> Okay .

as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . Right . Okay , cool . Um <vocalsound>
Mm Mm . yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Yeah , yeah , yeah . but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .

Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking Mm . and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Right . Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , <vocalsound> that would be another way to do it .

It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <vocalsound> and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <vocalsound>
Well how um on the <disfmarker> in this meeting then if we um <disfmarker> I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on Yep . decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um <vocalsound> . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting .
And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is <disfmarker> which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of <disfmarker> or more of like a <disfmarker> Sort of like a <disfmarker> I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um <disfmarker> Mm 'kay . Great . Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . Okay . Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Here we go . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . Okay . so that's why I suggested we get in this . Aye a fair point definitely . Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . Okay . Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um <vocalsound> quite user friendly while still having technology . So it <disfmarker> I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um <vocalsound> what we should think about is how the um <vocalsound> about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . <vocalsound> research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um <vocalsound> that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , do you know what I mean ? Okay okay . So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .
Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um <disfmarker> So then this <disfmarker> we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . Mm . Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at , <vocalsound> and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're <disfmarker> I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be .
any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um if we did decide to go for voice activation <vocalsound> there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong . Mm 'kay . And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , <vocalsound> and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . Mm . So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take Aye that's a good idea , yeah . and <gap> possibility . Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics . Yeah . And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable . <vocalsound> Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um <vocalsound> there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , Mm-hmm . so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um <vocalsound> if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . Okay .
Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . Right . Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . Mm . well I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements <vocalsound> , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , Right . Mm . okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , Mm-hmm . okay there's an L_C_D_ display , <vocalsound> I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . Yeah . Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , Mm-hmm . but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . We <disfmarker> you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't <disfmarker> I'm not very sure about the titanium . Mm 'kay . Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , Okay . I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , Mm-hmm . but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . Mm-hmm . You know as opposed to two . Mm-hmm . Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Power consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity , Hmm . um and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , <vocalsound> it's a wind-up <vocalsound> you know , a crank <vocalsound> . I'll clear one of these things for you . Yeah but that that might be something <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , Yeah . Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their <disfmarker> Hmm . you know you have <disfmarker> you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , Uh yeah yeah , I see . <vocalsound> you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . Hmm . Mm-hmm . um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of <disfmarker> small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . Mm-hmm . Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Mm-hmm . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it <disfmarker> um so . Mm-hmm Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . Mm . <vocalsound> Um the case <disfmarker> okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , <vocalsound> titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and It can't be curved . it can't be curved Okay . on the wood . So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light Mm .
Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . Yeah . We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? Mm . um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . Right . I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? Um <vocalsound> I think we could go for like um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . So maybe <disfmarker> do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or <disfmarker> Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . So something quite curvy ? Okay I think he made that . What's that ? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . Yeah . Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the <disfmarker> on the um <vocalsound> the colour , you said company colour yellow . Choice of material yeah . Like fruit . 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well <disfmarker> you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , <vocalsound> I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . See I'm <disfmarker> and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels <disfmarker> it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . And then then we could have curved shapes , so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . A snowman shape ? Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . Uh-huh . So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this <gap> here , had a sorta background yellow , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . Okay cool . Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . I think that might scare me . I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? I think that'd probably scare me . You turn it on your control possessed s <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I know . Um unless an a I mean if you <disfmarker> also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? What what's the functionality of that ? It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . Yeah but the question is what are we using it <disfmarker> What would it achieve ? what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a <disfmarker> L_C_ well I'd <disfmarker> when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , Right , okay . no um <disfmarker> I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ? Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? Um <vocalsound> well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . Okay . what else do you need to talk about ? Well i I was just <disfmarker> Where would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . um okay uh back we go . Um energy what <disfmarker> do you think that's suggesting we're <disfmarker> how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , Yeah , Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that <disfmarker> And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of <disfmarker> I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , Mm-hmm . um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . Mm 'kay . Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , Yeah clear , Yeah sure . Um in in a slight subtle way . S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . Yeah that'd be really good . Is that what you mean ? Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . Sure . Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . Lights . mm-hmm . Okay . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . Mm . Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? Or <disfmarker> Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , Mm . Yeah . Yeah . whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . Mm-hmm . yeah . Okay . Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , Yeah . and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , Mm . but not for channels right . If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? Yeah Yeah . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , Okay And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the <disfmarker> That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . It would get bumped , Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um <disfmarker> Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , Yeah that's what I was thinking the <disfmarker> that'd be great . a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . Yeah . and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . To make something flush with the case ? so that it has <disfmarker> Okay . and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . Sp kinda grippy ? Feel like fruit . Okay .
uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . So um <vocalsound> Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? Just for <disfmarker> in closing just <disfmarker> the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , Yeah .
I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? Um <vocalsound> I think we could go for like um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . So maybe <disfmarker> do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or <disfmarker> Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . So something quite curvy ? Okay
so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . A snowman shape ? Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . Uh-huh .
no um <disfmarker> I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?
Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um <disfmarker> Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , Yeah that's what I was thinking the <disfmarker>
so that it has <disfmarker> Okay . and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . Sp kinda grippy ?
Okay . and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . Sp kinda grippy ? Feel like fruit .
And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of <disfmarker>
Yeah , Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . Yeah . but yeah you c ask away . Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch um okay uh back we go . Um energy what <disfmarker> do you think that's suggesting we're <disfmarker> how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,
So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? Yeah So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this <gap> here , had a sorta background yellow , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . Okay cool . Yeah . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , Okay about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . Yeah . Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the <disfmarker> on the um <vocalsound> the colour , you said company colour yellow .

The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno .

Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , Yeah clear , Yeah sure . Um in in a slight subtle way . S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . Yeah that'd be really good . Is that what you mean ? Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . Sure . Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . Lights .
when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .

Um it might work for volume , Yeah . and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , Mm . but not for channels right . If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels ,
What's <disfmarker> Component , I think . Yeah . Components design . Yep that's it . I did this in a bit of a rush . N name . So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . Right . <vocalsound> Um you've got <vocalsound> a printed <vocalsound> a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber <vocalsound> nubbies into these little holes that activate <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah we've all broken a remote control . <vocalsound> So you've also got um <disfmarker> you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um <disfmarker> I just love you tech guys , huh . so you've got <disfmarker> here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I dunno who and whatnot . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> exactly . Nah . So um we've got a <disfmarker> i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip <vocalsound> I dunno . P Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh it's two double A_ batteries . This is pretty standard remote . So here are options for our power sources .
Well it is it is more uh <disfmarker> I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um our case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah pers Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . I think wood i <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It it it <disfmarker> Nah . I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever <disfmarker> whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . Right . And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some <disfmarker> a couple of these . Okay . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a <disfmarker> to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . You don't even need to lean down to get it . <vocalsound> The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is <disfmarker> w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape <vocalsound> So um <disfmarker> and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um <disfmarker> Okay . But basically these are <vocalsound> curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um <vocalsound> in their <vocalsound> message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , <vocalsound> uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . Okay . I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes Okay . Yeah that's what I see also . Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , Ooh . or multiple scrolling wheels . Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh <disfmarker> has at his disposal to put together a user interface . Okay . Uh it's two double A_ batteries . This is pretty standard remote . So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um <vocalsound> th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> Like this <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , And that's on the camera <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it <vocalsound> . Yeah . 'Kay . Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night <vocalsound> which doesn't make a lot of sense . Mm 'kay . And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? M battery versus cradle I think is <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . I like the kinetic . So we have battery versus cradle <vocalsound> <disfmarker>
Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh <disfmarker> has at his disposal to put together a user interface . Okay . For electronics , we have these very technical um <vocalsound> descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , <vocalsound> a regular chip , which is <vocalsound> like the medium porridge <disfmarker> the <vocalsound> medium expense uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? Yes oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . Um <vocalsound> an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , Okay . and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . Okay . So but yeah . Yeah that makes sense . That's the end of my presentation . So presentation from <disfmarker> I guess design would go best . Next .
But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go <disfmarker> That's right . Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . Up . I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly . Yeah so um taking that away , our uh <disfmarker> the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <disfmarker> Technical functions or interface concept ? I think <disfmarker> Oh interface concept . <vocalsound> Very long presentation . <vocalsound> somehow that thing's too big , but um <disfmarker> okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so . No . No . It it it <disfmarker> you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean it'll <disfmarker> if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . Yeah and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ? <vocalsound> That kinda would r d Well then why don't you just press the up button ? yeah .
I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly . Yeah so um taking that away , our uh <disfmarker> the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <disfmarker> Okay . You guys know your stuff . it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls .
or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . Um as for the point that we making about losing it . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , That I would believe . Mm . <vocalsound> But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . Um so <vocalsound> the the <disfmarker> what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without <disfmarker> with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . Mm-hmm . And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? Ye no it's not That's not a scroll wheel . i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , Nah . um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , <vocalsound> so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost . That be it .
Mm . Tha that I'm not concerned with . So now <disfmarker> If you if you give me <disfmarker> if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . So our big <vocalsound> questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Trend watching has a later date there . Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe . Well <vocalsound> I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the <disfmarker> when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . Are you talking about the picture ? Yeah yeah . That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a <disfmarker> that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . Okay . Okay . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . Mm . And and so <disfmarker> yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin <vocalsound> I don't say it's special . Uh I say that it's different I <disfmarker> what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm . I'd I'd say though that we <disfmarker> if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , What i <vocalsound> if when when we have <disfmarker> but wi with a similar <disfmarker> yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's <disfmarker> as as a marketing standard <disfmarker> I need something to market , to make this product unique . Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the <disfmarker> having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , Yep . um and also be really durable . Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . Right yeah . Yeah . Mm . Course . And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .
This <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And what I keep throwing out there <disfmarker> I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . Mm-hmm . But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . Yeah and I guess th th the question th <vocalsound> th that you're being asked right now is whether <disfmarker> is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . Oh okay I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . Well <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? Um <vocalsound> we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . No it's just different . It should be a really simple signal though so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control . And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . That's true yeah . But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's <disfmarker> Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh <disfmarker> So the scroll wheel , in or out ? Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified <vocalsound> for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , Yeah . <vocalsound> For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , It's just <disfmarker> it's basically <disfmarker> it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . <vocalsound> I I think there's <disfmarker> you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing <disfmarker> are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Instead of going button-to-bu you just <vocalsound> j you'd j j j j j j . That's kinda cool actually . I like that . Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . Well there's ano But <disfmarker> Well not n necessarily . You could basically make it so that it'll <disfmarker> I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . Right . If you do that . Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , Other than click click click . Primarily . Yep . Now the the only thing I I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> on the interface side of it , is that <vocalsound> I I I see the dilemma . <vocalsound> But if we have the option of of scrolling <vocalsound> at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . Mm-hmm . So I can go uh <vocalsound> presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . <vocalsound> I know what <disfmarker> because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So <vocalsound> I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? Mm-hmm . So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ? I think I know what you might be getting at , or or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh I see so if <disfmarker> maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? Oh no You'd need a display on the th the thing . Why ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . Yeah the the television can tell you . Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ? Well you just <disfmarker> it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in <disfmarker> Put <disfmarker> Yeah that's kinda cool . I like that . And again we have another another great marketing tool . We have about three <disfmarker> we have three or four things here . Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . Making it last . Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . Right . If you if you give me <disfmarker> if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . So our big <vocalsound> questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that <disfmarker> so wh what would you imagine it doing ? Yeah wh wh what's the <vocalsound> wh <vocalsound> Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . But would we <disfmarker> So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . Yeah . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co <vocalsound> it's a very competitive market . What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . Yeah . but on the other hand , I mean , it <disfmarker> I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know <disfmarker> if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use <disfmarker> if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . I don't think volume <disfmarker> I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno . No we can <disfmarker> we can do multiple scroll wheels but <disfmarker> Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the <vocalsound> uh dock to put it in <disfmarker> to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . Mm-hmm . because you're not going to be ditching it as often . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . Mm . and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh <disfmarker> What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . Mm-hmm . I'm thinking <disfmarker> yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , <vocalsound> where there's <disfmarker> you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused <disfmarker> the plastic with rubber on the outside . Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well no ma yeah Okay . So then if we <vocalsound> <disfmarker> d d do we want to do anything more basic with the <disfmarker> uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for <vocalsound> um buttons , or do we want <disfmarker> if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give <disfmarker> do we want to have anything else on it ? It's only a T_V_ . Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing <disfmarker> I mean it's <disfmarker> you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you <vocalsound> just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . Yeah right now there's <disfmarker> right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the <disfmarker> a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , Right . well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . <vocalsound> So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? <vocalsound> What what overall things have we not decided on ? Well we have to <disfmarker> I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another <disfmarker> it's just a an idea , and I don't know <disfmarker> Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because <vocalsound> I think , as far as durability th it's not a big <disfmarker> well maybe when it's closed . I mean what I see <disfmarker> one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , <vocalsound> their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . Mm-hmm .
okay we have five minutes . <vocalsound> So right details th <vocalsound> that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We want <vocalsound> a mode indicator . We want <vocalsound> back-lit buttons . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that . Okay . Just so you know I think <disfmarker> I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . but just kinda like a fused <disfmarker> the plastic with rubber on the outside . Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well no ma yeah
Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . 'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . Okay . It's one of the marketing features in this . That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . Mm-hmm . I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to <disfmarker> Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want <disfmarker> to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for We have to find cost . <disfmarker> with all these features <disfmarker> how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . that would be way too much , but the <disfmarker> I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much <disfmarker> I would say thirty five to forty .
We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . <gap> Thanks , yeah . Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh <disfmarker> Yeah .
We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . <gap> Thanks , yeah . Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh <disfmarker> Yeah .
I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly . Yeah so um taking that away , our uh <disfmarker> the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <disfmarker>
It's one of the marketing features in this . That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . Mm-hmm . I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . <gap>
It's one of the marketing features in this . That's why the scroll needs to be really robust .

It's one of the marketing features in this . where there's <disfmarker> you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused <disfmarker> the plastic with rubber on the outside . Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well no ma yeah That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . Mm-hmm .
okay we have five minutes . <vocalsound> So right details th <vocalsound> that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We want <vocalsound> a mode indicator . We want <vocalsound> back-lit buttons . It's one of the marketing features in this . That's why the scroll needs to be really robust .

Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . 'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . Okay . I would say thirty five to forty .

though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , For electronics , we have these very technical um <vocalsound> descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , <vocalsound> I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to ,
When I s when I see the <disfmarker> when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . Are you talking about the picture ? But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . Yeah and I guess th th the question th <vocalsound> th that you're being asked right now is whether <disfmarker> is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . Oh okay And and so <disfmarker> yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll
Uh okay . Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at <disfmarker> for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . Okay ?
But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , Okay ? Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess <disfmarker> Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . I think it's to get us used to using the pen . <vocalsound> Yes . A ratty . Rat . Not a mouse , a rat . A webbed foot . Oh , a fish . <vocalsound> Gosh , they have team elements . <vocalsound> I'm afraid I'm with Steph . And I think your pen's running out of whatever .
Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . Okay . Now um <vocalsound> we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold <disfmarker> um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now
we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold <disfmarker> um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh <disfmarker> and how many are we selling ? <vocalsound> Uh yeah . <vocalsound> I was just wondering if that's the um <disfmarker> If fifty percent is normal <disfmarker> Mark-up ? B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . But um let me <disfmarker> you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . At twenty five . That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each <disfmarker> And if we make <disfmarker> To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million . Hmm .
Okay ? Right . Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a <disfmarker> in a home environment , for a T_V_s and <disfmarker> You're both nodding , all three . Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . It is true that you always sit around <disfmarker> you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Y yeah . And they don't always talk to each other . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . Don't know . and what group would be be for ? We have to think about that one . We could make a Hello Kitty <vocalsound> themed remote . <vocalsound> I think one in b bright colours would be good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think one that works would be good . <vocalsound> We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great <vocalsound> products . Electrical <disfmarker> their industrial design is very good . I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , Yeah . you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that <disfmarker> being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , Okay . you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . Ooh ,
Okay . Now um <vocalsound> we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold <disfmarker> um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros .
Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million .
and how many are we selling ? <vocalsound> Uh yeah . <vocalsound> I was just wondering if that's the um <disfmarker> If fifty percent is normal <disfmarker> Mark-up ? B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . But um let me <disfmarker>
We've got some <gap> . <vocalsound> We've got a cool prototype . Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , Double curved . <vocalsound> yeah , double curved , Nice . um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . <vocalsound> That is cool . So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <vocalsound> the thumb button is the power button . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . And mute . For muting the uh <disfmarker> Um and then then you can also <disfmarker> there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . <vocalsound> Okay . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . That certainly does . <vocalsound> <gap> I think it does . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . Fashion to electronics . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh .
So d does that uh what <disfmarker> mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . Oh right , yeah . But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? Yes s Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <vocalsound> for the whole <disfmarker> the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . Mm . Sure . Sure . I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't think it's too <disfmarker> Yeah , it's not <disfmarker> But we can have both uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Have them in stock . Yeah .
Yeah . Um . One thing I do need to do <disfmarker> we need to look at , is the costs . The costs , was that what you said ? Okay , now I think we'll do this <disfmarker> Yeah . I could do <disfmarker> you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , Oh ho-ho . but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . Yep . Ooh . So <disfmarker> the case , we've gone for the double curved . Um and it's made out of rubber . <vocalsound> The interface is push-buttons . And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? It's better for <disfmarker> Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . <gap> . That is gonna cost uh <disfmarker> We're under budget . Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . That's cool .
Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it <disfmarker> is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ? Mm . I would give it a seven . Yeah . As in it's not . Oh , sorry , one . <vocalsound> Oh sorry , one , d yeah . A one . A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . Yeah . Three . Maybe three , yeah . <gap> three . So criteria three is is it easy to use ? Easy to use . But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? Mm . If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . Yeah . Give it a t give it a two . Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> 'Kay , criteria four is costs . <gap> Cost . It's come in under budget . <vocalsound> 's great . Yeah . So that's a definite one . That was great . Yeah . Amount of buttons . Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like <disfmarker> Contains only the necessary buttons . So it's a one ? Yeah . Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? <vocalsound> Yes s yeah . Yes . Very good . So it's anti-R_S_I_ . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ? It's yellow . <vocalsound> It is very bright , yeah . I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . <vocalsound> No ? But it is smallish . It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . I mean , it's not a one , definitely . I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but <disfmarker> Okay . So , <vocalsound> evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's <disfmarker> fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are ,
Number one product . Mm . not if you're left-handed it's not . I would give it a I would give it a two , That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . <gap> . Yeah . So , that's that . So that's the evaluation , so I'd say <disfmarker> Yay . <vocalsound> We've , we've done well . Alright it's all all systems go . It's like <vocalsound> <gap> like a number one . Um . Yeah .
Well done , Reissa . So that's that one . Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , <vocalsound> you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . Yeah . and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . <vocalsound> Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept <disfmarker> we tried to keep it cool and and <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fantastic . Now you guys have been a a great team . It is <gap> . I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't <disfmarker> we're not just rehashing an old design . But I'm not the authority to say that it is . Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? I love it . <vocalsound> I love it . <vocalsound> I think it's cool . <vocalsound> thingy , <vocalsound> that's great . Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not <disfmarker> Yeah . it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . Mm . Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . Yeah . It's new , it's it's um something that uh <vocalsound> that isn't out there already . I think actually <disfmarker> and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . Mm .
I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . Oh right , yeah . But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? Yes s Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <vocalsound> for the whole <disfmarker> the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . Mm . Sure . Sure . I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't think it's too <disfmarker> Yeah , it's not <disfmarker> But we can have both uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Have them in stock . Yeah .
Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager . Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close ,
since we only have twenty five minutes . First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three <vocalsound> compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas
<vocalsound> I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . Thanks . Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh Mm . and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . Snake . Well . It's a whale <vocalsound> , yes . Em Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ .
<vocalsound> Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple <vocalsound> we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such <disfmarker> this is for television it's a <disfmarker> we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for .
If it's just a television then that <disfmarker> it's a bit simpler , So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could <disfmarker> I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you <disfmarker> what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so <disfmarker> Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . I just wanna watch the T_V_ <vocalsound> um . I find them <disfmarker> they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of <disfmarker> in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? but we could <disfmarker> but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . Mm . Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for <disfmarker> that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , Mm-hmm . channel changing . And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , Yeah . then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the <disfmarker> whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm . and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . Um . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only <vocalsound> Good question . um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <vocalsound> I don't know that yet . Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? Mm . It's a good question . Um . <vocalsound> I'll look into that . Mm-hmm hmm . Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that <disfmarker> it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . Large . Yeah . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . Mm . Mm . Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um just has <disfmarker> No
Mm-hmm hmm . Mm . It's a good question . Um . <vocalsound> I'll look into that .
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Yeah .
Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Yeah . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for <gap> . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .
Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for <gap> . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .
Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um . Okay . Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ? Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm . Cool I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two ,
and because this is such <disfmarker> this is for television it's a <disfmarker> we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple <vocalsound> we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales
and because this is such <disfmarker> this is for television it's a <disfmarker> we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , We're gonna talk about project finances .

Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . Um .
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm .
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for <disfmarker> that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , Mm-hmm . channel changing .

Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um just has <disfmarker> No
Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only <vocalsound> Good question . um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <vocalsound> I don't know that yet .

Yeah . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . Mm .
Yeah well , ja well let's just start . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've uh made a presentation Right let's see it . uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . So it's in the project documents <vocalsound> Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh <vocalsound> I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , Oh sorry . <vocalsound> And <gap> an uh a nice agenda . <vocalsound> Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . <vocalsound> We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So <vocalsound> this the opening we'll uh <disfmarker> We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . Mm-hmm . Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's <vocalsound> also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh <disfmarker> Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . Mm-hmm . Other uh <disfmarker> There happen to be uh three stages . <gap> functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh <vocalsound> Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . <gap> you have a <disfmarker> these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . <vocalsound> This is just a <gap> . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Of course w <vocalsound> doesn't work any more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wonderful . It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away . Mm-hmm . Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . <vocalsound> Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . <vocalsound> <gap> .
Yeah , 'kay . Hmm ? I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're kinda losing time , though . Alright . what ? We're losing time , but <disfmarker> Ah <vocalsound> the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other <gap> so start <disfmarker> No ? It's just a bird . Well wonderful . Uh current colour . and current colour <gap> you choose a new colour . <vocalsound> And a new pen width uh <gap> also format . I like uh <disfmarker> Oh I know it . Well what is it , huh ? It's a hedgehog . I don't know how to call it . We're going back <vocalsound> and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . <vocalsound> I am the Industrial Designer . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> It's a pussy cat . It's a cat . <vocalsound> Oh Pussy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Uh well I think it's obvious right now . Yes alright . It's a cat . <vocalsound> No it looks great . No no save it and start a new uh <disfmarker> save it These are very impor <vocalsound> and start a new black uh doc <gap> a blank document . These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh <disfmarker> Yeah well we have to save everything Yes uh right . <vocalsound> Thanks . <vocalsound> Yeah . There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . So um well you should uh try it but uh <disfmarker> So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , <vocalsound> not my idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright , your favourite animal ? <vocalsound> Yes our your favourite . but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast <vocalsound> Grizzly bear . <vocalsound>
Please ? <vocalsound> No uh I did . <vocalsound> it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh <disfmarker> Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then <disfmarker> I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . Yeah something like that . Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So <disfmarker> So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . Right . Alright . Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first <gap> about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? Right . because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh <disfmarker> <gap>
Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then <disfmarker> I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . Yeah . Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . Yeah yeah . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Yep . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player That's alright . Yeah right . Yep , and maybe we do uh <vocalsound> we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? And stereo uh s uh audio installations . Uh . Yeah . And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design <disfmarker> Hmm .
so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . Yep yep yep . Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to <gap> well fifty million ? Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . <vocalsound> so a lot of people have to be able to use it . No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yes . and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . Yeah . I also think we should not add too many buttons . Right . Modern day uh remotes have <vocalsound> too much buttons I think . No that's right . Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's <gap> Precisely . culture uh international . Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ Yeah . and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . Yeah indeed . Yes . Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh <disfmarker> Yeah right .
Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful Yes . or else uh they would have been ano another shape . Well <vocalsound> for me personally I have a <vocalsound> a lot of remotes uh at home but <vocalsound> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <vocalsound> I don't like to use them . I have uh have to <disfmarker> it has to fit my hands . Yeah . Yeah . When it falls over it and I just have <disfmarker> and then the button that I use most has to be here . It shouldn't be boxy . Yeah . Yeah It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with <gap> thumb . Nah <disfmarker> I don't agree with the long box uh shape <vocalsound> it it has to be custom made for the hand . Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . Yeah . But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , Yeah but if you shape it <disfmarker> but then you have <disfmarker> No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ <gap> with their uh remotes <vocalsound> pl players <vocalsound> they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . If <disfmarker> D_V_D_ players . Yes . <vocalsound> W no w what else ? No that's ol old fashioned . I di I can imagine that us Yes uh <disfmarker> Well <vocalsound> most of <gap> of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . Yeah right . Mm . but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh <vocalsound> round forms in it to fit your hand , Yeah Well <disfmarker> A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . Um . Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . Yeah yeah I understand , It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . but <disfmarker> no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but a also with round edges of course , <gap> . but in in in at the end it's still this long <vocalsound> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh <vocalsound> to fit . Yeah . and so you can <disfmarker> I've <disfmarker> A big recognisable button on top or something . Yeah right , We have five minutes left . The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , Right . <vocalsound> and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . Yes uh that's <vocalsound> yep . But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Yep . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Uh-huh . Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah . Yeah right right , <vocalsound> Yeah . and maybe we should use colours . Colours , yeah . Yeah but it's <disfmarker> it has to be useable . It has to be different and familiar at the same time . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . Yep . <gap> yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing <gap> Yeah . you can make it uh triangle shaped , <vocalsound> No . but that's not uh very recognisable . Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and <disfmarker> Oo Oval ? N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . I <disfmarker> Yeah or so So <vocalsound> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah , right . No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> but young people want something different and it is <disfmarker> Well i we already uh <disfmarker> Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so <disfmarker> Yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another <disfmarker> Yeah alright . Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to <disfmarker> we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market .
and maybe we should use colours . Colours , yeah . Yeah <gap> maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well <gap> <vocalsound> you can you can put on on them , Yeah . Ha . and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs <vocalsound> That's kinda trendy . Yeah right . I dunno but <disfmarker> Sound nice . Yes . I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well it's just uh about our first ideas now <gap> . so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Right . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , Already thought about something tha <vocalsound> This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . Yeah . <vocalsound> No problem . Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah now we can still talk about the material , Yeah yes say . we have some some minutes left uh <gap> Mm . I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , Yeah . the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . <gap> . No n n <gap> . Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . but that's pretty obvious , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . I think <vocalsound> we should make it universal Yeah . and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it <vocalsound> just plain Yes . but you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> To make it more trendy . <gap> . Yes . Yes . Right . And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well you can make profit with them , and it's <vocalsound> a way to make them trendy . Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself <vocalsound> so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something Yeah right . uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , No a colour everyone accepts . so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . <gap> standard . But people of often don't like bright colours or something . <gap> . We have to make it grey or s or black . Well young people s li Yeah or a t Teletubby front . <vocalsound> But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yes . <vocalsound> Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh <gap> I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .
I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well it's just uh about our first ideas now <gap> . so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Right .
Yes . <vocalsound> Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh <gap> I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .
I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well it's just uh about our first ideas now <gap> . so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Right .
but that's pretty obvious , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . I think <vocalsound> we should make it universal
or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . <vocalsound> And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , <vocalsound> uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <vocalsound> Yeah . A very warm welcome again to everyone . <vocalsound> Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Yes . Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . Yeah . Thank you . Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um <vocalsound> well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button , <vocalsound> uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh <vocalsound> button just presses on a <gap> Sorry . <vocalsound> on a little print plate <vocalsound> and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled <vocalsound> to uh several transistors which makes Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . That's basically uh how it works . Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh <vocalsound> and chips . <vocalsound> Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . Uh I made a little uh uh animation of <vocalsound> about how a tran our uh remote controller works . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Uh well <vocalsound> the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something ,
Well uh , my name's <gap> , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um <vocalsound> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it <disfmarker> I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation .
if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? Yeah , touch screen , yeah . Okay . The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . Mm . 'Kay . So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot <disfmarker> not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , Kijke <gap> 'Kay , so . <vocalsound> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just <disfmarker> Yeah , and the users , actually . <vocalsound> The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . <gap> Goed so . 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . <vocalsound> So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , <vocalsound> Yeah . but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . <vocalsound> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , Mm . and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera .
L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use <vocalsound> because you have <disfmarker> you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . And that is it . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . <vocalsound> So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera .
thank you all , huh . <vocalsound> No . Res I did not . <vocalsound> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? No . Perhaps the rest ? then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them Ja , <gap> Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does <disfmarker> has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . Oh . Mm . <vocalsound> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? Be television . Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? Yeah . Only be used for television . Yeah . Functions . Mm-hmm . Then it should have uh on , off , Yeah for <disfmarker> Yeah , Standby options , and uh <disfmarker> the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , yeah ? yes yes s sh <vocalsound> Yeah A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . I had <disfmarker> I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , It makes it twelve , yeah . Yeah . and that's that's not relaxed Indeed . Okay . So that it <vocalsound> easy and fast . Yeah . But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Yeah . Mm . Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . Forties , okay because <vocalsound> because younger people as Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and then you can use it again . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . Yeah but a <disfmarker> you don't know <disfmarker> A touch screen uh probably uh even more . An perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . Is it possible to find out , anyway ? No , I don't have any costs here , You know ? I only have percentages . But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . Um just uh displays several buttons , Yeah ? for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen Oh right , and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . so you can <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? Yeah . I think it's the most easier thing , Would be yeah . Yeah . But <disfmarker> But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , Yeah , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? but <disfmarker> forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . Oh , But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . Yeah . i i if it <disfmarker> Yeah , if it costs <disfmarker> gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . N Yeah , so so uh <disfmarker> if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , okay . But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Mm . Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen . but they don't they don't like it . Yeah . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Um . Yeah . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . Yeah . Okay ? Okay , what else does our remote need ? Um <disfmarker> A mute button . Mute button . Mm-hmm . I think . <vocalsound> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , And <disfmarker> Yeah . and power s power usage . Yeah . And a teletext , but that is not of the question . But <disfmarker> Other things are <disfmarker> But shouldn't you put a button of <disfmarker> for teletext on the <disfmarker> for the people who want to use it ? Sorry ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . Yeah , teletext . And there's also a <disfmarker> And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , Less important . A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . Yeah , sub-menu , yeah . Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh <gap> batteries to uh to be <disfmarker> Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things . You should <disfmarker> Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . Yeah . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , Nee that's that's so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . uh yeah . But then you can't <disfmarker> And go to standby mode when you don't use it , Yeah . Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . Yeah . Sure . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger . Mm . <vocalsound> So we are going for the for the recharger . Yeah . So . Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , Yeah High power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , Yes . that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions . Yeah , you made a point there . <vocalsound> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch Yeah , also . because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . Yeah , Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , Yeah . Yeah . points . I think . Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points Also . uh , or <disfmarker> Well I think that this should be standard . Large button <disfmarker> large buttons . Yeah <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> . And you said something about speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Yeah , twelve Euro fifty . Twelve . That's an <disfmarker> twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <vocalsound> also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . So it's pretty big . <vocalsound> W I know let's do a speech . <vocalsound> let's leave out all the remote controls But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , Yeah . but do we want to implement that , or ? <vocalsound> I think an L_C_D_ screen <vocalsound> should be suf sufficient . Yeah . But when you look at the percentages <disfmarker> Yeah , Why not ? maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . Yeah . Let's hope uh to have some uh d I know <vocalsound> No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . Mm . But would it be useful to imple implement both ? Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <vocalsound> On one remote ? We should do it . Yeah . Sure . but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , Yeah . or ? Uh . Certain systems already exist , I think . Mm-hmm . Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y <vocalsound> it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English Yeah . True . Yeah . But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . This should be uh accommodated with some software , Swahili . Swahili . Yeah you can use icons for the we have to keep <disfmarker> Yeah . Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . Yeah . <vocalsound> For speech recognition . Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um <disfmarker> or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . Mm . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons Mm , yes . You also now have colours . I don't know if we should implement that . Curved ? Yeah , Okay . Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and <disfmarker> What else can you do with a television ? We've got anon Aren't we forgetting something very important ? Have got got two examples here , so this is your presentation . We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . Yeah , Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and <disfmarker> Menu . Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . Yeah , Oh right . Yeah . Channel settings . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . <vocalsound> Yeah . And Colours . Yeah . and the buttons , should they have colours ? Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . Oh Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo <vocalsound> Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <vocalsound> . Adjust with phones , yes <vocalsound> Twelve Euro fifty . Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? Sure . Channel settings ? Oh yeah , right . Channel settings . So you can program the T_V_ . Yeah , no problem . Yep . So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons <disfmarker> Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . Yeah , but but or like you have Which one ? you only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can <disfmarker> But that's also in the L_C_D_ , Yeah , Right , yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , So we don't have any normal buttons th No , alright . Maybe only the on and o on and off button . Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . Yeah . But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , No no no , Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the <disfmarker> I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , No . yeah . Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , No you just tap I think . Yeah , you tap . or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . Yeah , Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . Yeah , I think so too . Yeah . Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Mm-hmm . I guess we have to <vocalsound> Oh , okay <gap> postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time .
Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does <disfmarker> has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . Oh . Mm . <vocalsound> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television ,
Oh . Mm . <vocalsound> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market ,
Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before .
which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products ,
And there's also a <disfmarker> And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , Yeah , I think we should <disfmarker> we could that <disfmarker> and you can't go to sport . we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Channel settings ? Oh yeah , right . perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , Channel settings . So you can program the T_V_ . Oh right . Yeah . Channel settings . Yeah , what else does our remote need ? Um <disfmarker> A mute button . Mute button . Mm-hmm .

Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_
But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Yeah , yeah . So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? Yeah . I think it's the most easier thing , Would be yeah . Yeah , okay .
and <disfmarker> Okay . Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . Yeah , teletext .

Yeah . Sure . Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .
Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger . Mm . <vocalsound> So we are going for the for the recharger . Yeah .
we have to keep <disfmarker> Yeah . Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . Yeah . <vocalsound> For speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . Mm . But would it be useful to imple implement both ? Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <vocalsound> On one remote ? Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Yeah . <vocalsound>
points . I think . Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points Also . and if there's enough money , speech recognition . Mm . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons Mm , yes .
Right , yeah , okay . <vocalsound> I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . So we don't have any normal buttons th Yeah , Yeah , I think so too . Yeah . Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Yeah . <vocalsound>
i i if it <disfmarker> Yeah , if it costs <disfmarker> gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah , can you um uh s and then you can use it again . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . Yeah but a <disfmarker> you don't know <disfmarker> A touch screen uh probably uh even more . An N Yeah , so so uh <disfmarker> if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the <disfmarker> Yeah , you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . Is it possible to find out , anyway ? No , I don't have any costs here , You know ?
but also on the older , Yeah , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? but <disfmarker> But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . Yeah . But <disfmarker> But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people ,
and power s power usage . Yeah . And a teletext , but that is not of the question . But <disfmarker> Other things are <disfmarker> But shouldn't you put a button of <disfmarker> for teletext on the <disfmarker> for the people who want to use it ? Sorry ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . Yeah , teletext .
Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things . You should <disfmarker> Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . Yeah . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
High power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , Yes .
just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , you made a point there . <vocalsound> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch Yeah , also . because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . Yeah , Yeah just
Why not ? maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . Yeah . I know <vocalsound> No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . Mm . But would it be useful to imple implement both ? Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <vocalsound> On one remote ? We should do it . Yeah . Sure . but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , Yeah . or ? Uh . Certain systems already exist , I think . Mm-hmm . Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y <vocalsound> it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> . And you said something about speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Yeah , twelve Euro fifty . Twelve . That's an <disfmarker> twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <vocalsound> also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . So it's pretty big . <vocalsound> W I know let's do a speech . <vocalsound> let's leave out all the remote controls For speech recognition . Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Yeah . <vocalsound> But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , Yeah . but do we want to implement that , or ? <vocalsound> I think an L_C_D_ screen <vocalsound> should be suf sufficient . Yeah . But when you look at the percentages <disfmarker> Yeah ,
Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . Yeah . But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , I know <vocalsound> No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , No no no , Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the <disfmarker> I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , No . yeah . Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , No you just tap I think . Yeah , you tap . or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . Yeah , Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . Yeah , I think so too . No , alright . Maybe only the on and o on and off button . Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . <vocalsound> Alright , excellent . <vocalsound> We used those <gap> . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , He's gonna get his pen . Oh right . Okay . Um <vocalsound> Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? Yeah , So <vocalsound> there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . Oh yeah , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So are there any um improvements or issues or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Kay and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . We made three for you . Three ? Oh . Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , Mm-hmm . mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . Uh can I have <gap> It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Okay , brilliant mm . Um the black on the back is the slogan . Okay , nice and obvious there <vocalsound> , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . you can <disfmarker> you all can hold it , is <disfmarker> it does actually feel quite ergonomic , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized <gap> . Okay . It would have to be a bit bigger .
mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , Okay . We made three for you . Three ? Oh . Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , Mm-hmm .
These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing .
So <vocalsound> there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . Oh yeah , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . <vocalsound>
No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us <disfmarker> Mm . Oh that's fine . Yeah , so we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . Cool . Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . <vocalsound> Oh . Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . Mm . why is it doing that ? There we go . <vocalsound> So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . Mm-hmm . And by doing so <disfmarker> Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . I don't know what's going on with this again . W why is the uh double curved two of them ? Oh , good point . And double curve on both sides ? So double-curve . No , I think it means double curved as in um Like an S_ shape . like uh <gap> a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay . Yeah , <gap> got two of them <disfmarker> and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . Right . No . <vocalsound> Cut things out . But you think it should be one . It's meant to be one , yeah ,
Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So <disfmarker> We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . Yeah . Cool . Um <vocalsound> So we could even add something . We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah yeah , we could add things . <vocalsound>
So just general thumbs up for all of us then . <vocalsound> Oh we've been writing this up for m months . I think it went quite smoothly . Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? W I think we were very creative . <vocalsound> Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry . Great leadership . <vocalsound> Excellent leadership . <vocalsound> You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh Right . Um Yeah . <vocalsound> These pens are are neat though . I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . <vocalsound> Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas ,
I I will <disfmarker> first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? Um <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . S I would say seven . Seven . Uh . <vocalsound> Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't <disfmarker> True or false ? No sorry tr one is true . One , yeah . <vocalsound> Uh one is <disfmarker> means highest ranking , Yeah . Okay , right right . Okay , so one . So it's one for from your point of view . Yep . <vocalsound> Um <gap> I'm gonna give it a two . Two . Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? Oh , I'll go for a one . <vocalsound> You will go for one . Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . Come on that was the tha <vocalsound> No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . Okay . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , <vocalsound> Being fruitist . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and <disfmarker> Yeah . Is that no is that not trends ? <vocalsound> So . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> because whatever companies <disfmarker> they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . Uh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um <disfmarker> you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have <disfmarker> That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . Adding them up ? we are doing a very wrong thing . We're gonna average them ? Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , Oh . I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh About one point f one point eight . three four four two six seven seven sev Okay . Uh . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , <vocalsound> so I would actually give it a three . <vocalsound> That's fine . Uh <disfmarker> 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ? Yeah . Um so I'd give the company strategy a <vocalsound> two . Okay . Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Okay . Um yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a <disfmarker> a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by <disfmarker> Mm . So th seven seven . Uh overall we are getting two <gap> something , but we can round it as two . So we can launch it . Yeah . Brilliant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In which case we are done . 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry . Thank you . So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . Mm-hmm . How we are going to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> means uh at what standard what standard <disfmarker> whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is <disfmarker> will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . Okay . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as <gap> fashion trends or not ? Means <vocalsound> because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . Mm-hmm . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite <gap> in the market , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So <disfmarker> Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . Okay .
mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um We made three for you . Three ? Oh . Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , Mm-hmm .
So <vocalsound> there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . Oh yeah , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . <vocalsound>
Um the black on the back is the slogan . Okay , nice and obvious there <vocalsound> , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .
It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Okay , brilliant mm .
this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . O okay ,
So we can launch it . Yeah . Brilliant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In which case we are done . 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh-huh . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . Come on that was the tha <vocalsound>
Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie . 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um and I guess we should all get acquainted <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Let's <disfmarker> shall we all introduce ourselves ? Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um so . <vocalsound> I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . Okay .
So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um <vocalsound> so we're gonna try out our white board . I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . Okay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . <vocalsound> Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to <disfmarker> um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um <vocalsound> so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? Okay . <vocalsound> I think both . <vocalsound> Yeah . Both . Yeah <vocalsound> . Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and <vocalsound> all that . No ? Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . Okay . How many should we sell then ? <vocalsound> Um , a lot , Four million . And it <disfmarker> well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country <vocalsound> . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . Sorry can you just say that <disfmarker> what's the <disfmarker> what are our price goals again ?
so you can programme like your favourite channels , Till the meeting <disfmarker> oh right . This is what we have left . I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , Um , oh we just <gap> I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So . You <disfmarker> what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . That would be cool . So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I was thinking that too . Select . Uh . s y yeah but you can programme , Yeah . I think we should design something that has like a <disfmarker> so you can <disfmarker> like somehow like you <disfmarker> I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like if you had a s But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . That's something we could decide . Mm . I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a <disfmarker> maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . and it's like a hand held like <disfmarker> turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like <disfmarker> so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if <disfmarker> it must be <disfmarker> it would probably <disfmarker> What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could <disfmarker> I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true . Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point <disfmarker> twelve fifty for <disfmarker> to actually make the device . Yeah . Yeah . Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um <disfmarker> What was the word ? <vocalsound> Furry . Water resistant . Oh I was just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah so we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the project is now couches and remote controls . But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive . maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . Yeah . Mm , mm . That's quite annoying . Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your <disfmarker> Something like that . And the other thing is <disfmarker> Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? Bigger . Yeah . Like Hand Hand-sized . hand held size , yeah .
So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .

Uh . s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . That's something we could decide . Mm . and it's like a hand held like <disfmarker> turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like <disfmarker> so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if <disfmarker> it must be <disfmarker> it would probably <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true . Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point <disfmarker> twelve fifty for <disfmarker> to actually make the device . Yeah .

Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your <disfmarker> Yeah .
yeah <vocalsound> um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . Yeah , what does it stand for again ? Uh , User Interface design . User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function . The working design is the structure . Yeah , yeah . What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what <disfmarker> It said <disfmarker> okay . Alright . okay . Right . I'm I'm on task . And the M_E_ , what does that stand for <vocalsound> ? M Marketing . Marketing , right . Um <vocalsound> . Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . So we'll be working on the user requirements , um <disfmarker> Yeah . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , Yeah I think so .
yeah <vocalsound> um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , Yeah I think so .
Yeah , what does it stand for again ? Uh , User Interface design . User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function . The working design is the structure .
And the M_E_ , what does that stand for <vocalsound> ? M Marketing . Marketing , right . Um <vocalsound> . Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . So we'll be working on the user requirements , um <disfmarker> Yeah .
Mm . Uh <disfmarker> So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . he's uh obviously late for some reason . <vocalsound> Good . Um . Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design . Mm-hmm . Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh <gap> . Uh I will take some minutes uh again . Mm-hmm . Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , Yep . Yep . and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . So and that uh will uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh . Mm-hmm .
So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ? I have a presentation , I'm just making this <disfmarker> Yeah I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah the <disfmarker> Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here Okay . because it's really a a team uh project with a team Ah there is Matthew . and if someone is not here then we cannot <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ? So we have to work out a way <disfmarker> what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . Um . This is <disfmarker> to do this I will not remove my microphone . <vocalsound> We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , <vocalsound> and as part of this <disfmarker> The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out <vocalsound> .
Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out <vocalsound> . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um <disfmarker> That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative <disfmarker> has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say <gap> got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to <disfmarker> be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um .
Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to <disfmarker> be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . <vocalsound> This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um . Hmm . So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? Spongy feel ? Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , Okay . Mm . rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . Yeah . as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um .
Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those <disfmarker> a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that . Mm-hmm . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe <disfmarker> to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . Yeah . Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't <disfmarker> I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . Mm-hmm . I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very <disfmarker> will be a really cool feature to put in . And <disfmarker> <gap> use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , Mm . yeah Yeah . <disfmarker> and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . Mm . it was a good idea maybe to to <disfmarker> To let the people choose , <gap> you mean ? Yes the the the there are changeable covers , Yeah . but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because <vocalsound> you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational <disfmarker> Hmm . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , Hmm . Mm-hmm . we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . I mean that would <gap> would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro <vocalsound> . Yeah . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um .
You can have it so it's easy <gap> they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , A standard . And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are <vocalsound> having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is <gap> now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , Mm-hmm . Yeah . or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . Um yes You can't . And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . Mm-hmm . Mm . which is again <disfmarker> and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh <disfmarker> it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . Mm . Yeah . At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also <vocalsound> <gap> or <disfmarker> coming back to one point Two thirty five supposed to finish . y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? Yeah you can let them to do that . And uh isn't that too difficult for the <disfmarker> we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , Hmm . N no but the <disfmarker> if you give <disfmarker> it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . Yeah . I think you can do it both ways . So it de so um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay so m so <vocalsound> then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . So what I have found was that uh currently uh the <gap> they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have Mm .
so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , <gap> . it it it's like it <gap> limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for <vocalsound> eighty word thing , eighty word , Mm-hmm . which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , Mm . you want to st store your favourite channel . Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . Yeah some ten twelve channel information . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . I personally would look at <vocalsound> things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having <gap> unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . Mm-hmm . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , <vocalsound> and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , Mm b you know , and uh <disfmarker> But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . <vocalsound> Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word Mm . and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing Mm . Mm . and uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like <disfmarker> You can basically <disfmarker> if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the <gap> T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information <vocalsound> . Mm . Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . Yeah yeah That's a good idea .
Mm-hmm yeah like <vocalsound> I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , Yeah . and you can uh check how much how much they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , yeah yeah Mm . yeah . and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . Maybe we can come <vocalsound> we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , but but I do <vocalsound> <disfmarker> maybe you can <vocalsound> give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I'm sorry to have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Every time I have to come down on this price again Hmm . Hmm . to <vocalsound> so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real <disfmarker> do we think these ideas <vocalsound> an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh <vocalsound> uh case of the <disfmarker> Mm .
m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . Yes . Yes . Mm-hmm . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . Mm-hmm . So they also emailed me that uh they have <vocalsound> available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a <gap> computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , Yeah . so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . And the final point okay is um we have <disfmarker> yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . Hmm . So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but <vocalsound> I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . Mm-hmm . and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert Sorry . Mm . so that we can <disfmarker> it's really a team-working uh . So No of course . of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , Yes . or if you want to store a programmes with a keys <disfmarker> What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside <disfmarker> W wh what <disfmarker> Yeah it's kind of um simple <gap> pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . W what <disfmarker> Okay . I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions Okay . where they do all the wi with with them actually . Okay . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . Yeah . Yeah good idea . So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , Yes . yeah . So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . Do you think that's feasible ? Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . Uh <disfmarker> You th you think it's possible . Yeah also thinking , I think both uh <disfmarker> if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , Sorry . but uh <disfmarker> <gap> . Well maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . Yeah that's an excellent idea . Mm yes wh when you make a <vocalsound> a design ca you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . Yeah yeah . Yeah Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . Yeah . For example if f if you want to put wood <disfmarker> I wouldn't suggest for wood Okay . uh <gap> 'cause it's <disfmarker> I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber <gap> rather than wood . I agree on that . Yeah . Mm . It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials Do do you agree ? Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , Mm yeah sure . Yeah . and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh <vocalsound> graphs or I don't know uh <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Yeah customized . <gap> . We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . Mm . Um . Okay <vocalsound> <gap> . We can give them smooth keys , you know . Smooth keys with bigger s uh <disfmarker> So that you know <disfmarker> The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , Yeah . and uh <vocalsound> now you can , for example , as I was <gap> if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . Hmm . You see ? I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah . Yeah . Mm well Yeah . one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , Mm mm mm . which you don't use . Mm . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . Yeah . Can we have <disfmarker> can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box Yeah I like also this one . Yeah , mm . the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should <vocalsound> dec decide numbers or <disfmarker> Mm mm 'kay . So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . Mm-hmm . So the method is <disfmarker> ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like <gap> , and uh what cost <disfmarker> the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . So there are two uh different types of uh um <disfmarker> Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . Nice . <vocalsound> Hmm . Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an <gap> that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board <gap> buttons , infrared <vocalsound> , led , etcetera , for the components um . So you <gap> finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , Mm-hmm . that amplify to make it stronger um . So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think <vocalsound> for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , Yeah mm mm-hmm . and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to <gap> them and connect them . Mm-hmm . So my personal design <vocalsound> we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or <vocalsound> Well well
<vocalsound> Yeah sure . maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . Yeah that's an excellent idea . Mm yes wh when you make a <vocalsound> a design ca you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . Yeah yeah . Yeah And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . So um <disfmarker> Let let's say next meeting w <vocalsound> you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
Is this for the next meeting though ? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . <vocalsound> Mm . that <disfmarker> yeah next meeting we should be <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . Ju just make two designs , Yeah that would depend upon us actually . Yeah yeah yeah . and the we we can decide decide between th those designs . Yep . is this <disfmarker> is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? Um yes I come to that uh uh <disfmarker> Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . Mm . Okay well is this <vocalsound> me designing a way to evaluate it so <disfmarker> Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? <vocalsound> I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time Mm . but a as far as possible . Okay . Yep . Two . Two ? One for like cost and the one with like higher-end I <disfmarker> Mm <gap> and then <disfmarker> Mm . so that then we can be easily comparing them Yeah Okay let's call this to an end . Mm 'kay .
I come to that uh uh <disfmarker> Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . Yes well Um yes
uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . Mm .
So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes Exactly . Okay . Yep .
Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email . Two or three prototypes ?
and uh <vocalsound> now you can , for example , as I was <gap> if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . Hmm . You see ? I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah . Yeah . Okay <vocalsound> <gap> . We can give them smooth keys , you know . Smooth keys with bigger s uh <disfmarker> So that you know <disfmarker> The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , Yeah .
And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . So um <disfmarker> Let let's say next meeting w <vocalsound> you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . <vocalsound> Yeah sure . yeah . So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . Do you think that's feasible ? Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . Uh <disfmarker> You th you think it's possible . maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . Yeah that's an excellent idea . Mm yes wh when you make a <vocalsound> a design ca you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . Yeah yeah . Yeah
Yep . Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . <vocalsound> 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What <disfmarker> the first thing <disfmarker> question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that <disfmarker> well it wasn't really my area
So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Um and uh <vocalsound> I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . Mm-hmm . is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the <gap> surrounding it ? Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , Mm-hmm . they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? Yeah the the <disfmarker> They are . well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones Okay . Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . <vocalsound> Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the <disfmarker> w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the <vocalsound> uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would <disfmarker> the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to <vocalsound> whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and <disfmarker> reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the <disfmarker> it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of <disfmarker> d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa <vocalsound> thing that you could have , Mm .
<gap> okay . Oh , there <gap> . Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , Yeah . but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's <disfmarker> it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering <gap> maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will <gap> this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you <disfmarker> you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like <disfmarker> it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh <disfmarker> added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not <disfmarker> of no use of punching in the uh <disfmarker> trying to put in those things in <disfmarker> on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in <disfmarker> add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's <disfmarker> so this is <disfmarker> if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use <disfmarker> usage and all that . Yeah .
Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . Yeah . So again there's power implications there . <vocalsound> Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take <disfmarker> said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh <disfmarker> when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . but I think I'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information I can email you extra details , <vocalsound> Look at that . Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . <vocalsound> Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . <vocalsound> Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , Okay . um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um <vocalsound> our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just channel-hopping . yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but <vocalsound> I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . Would that imply video use ? But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well . T yeah yeah . and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and <vocalsound> programming . Yes . Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good .
Yeah . and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , Yeah . Um , think that might appeal <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , Mm . Mm-hmm . Um , we need to focus on that as well . Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty
and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first <disfmarker> it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ , Mm-hmm . we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , Video plus . yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , Yeah yeah . Sure , okay . Mm-hmm . Um , what other functions ? We need <disfmarker> I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about <disfmarker> c 'cause you've got the dilemma between <disfmarker> oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , and if you had uh <disfmarker> when you <disfmarker> th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , Yeah . it's just a number . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . Yeah . Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . yeah . Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful <vocalsound> . Yeah It is after um <disfmarker> if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards It's not <disfmarker> and if <disfmarker> yeah if you if you had if you had one of those <disfmarker> uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh <disfmarker> Yeah yeah , okay . S So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? Yeah some sort of docking station or <disfmarker> Yes . Rechargeable with a docking station . Mm-hmm . what preference <disfmarker> so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . For detection , right .
I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to <disfmarker> for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , Yeah . but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . Not for such simple functions Mm . yes okay . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible Simple . Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , <gap> to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? Mm . <vocalsound> But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um <disfmarker> the companies who uh who you deal with have actually <disfmarker> they've they've got an obligation to to help you out Mm . Mm-hmm . and also <disfmarker> I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having <disfmarker> Right . okay , just a thought . Um <disfmarker> I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . Instruction manuals . Okay . But I mean they're <disfmarker> there's customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to Yeah .
Yeah we could look in at that . you know even though we're using plastic , you can still <disfmarker> I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . Mm . You could have different kind of casings . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa Yeah . and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't <disfmarker> not gonna lose it so much <vocalsound> either . It's easier to <disfmarker> bit nice to handle . Mm . Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are <disfmarker> whichever appeals the most like , which it is cheaper in the long run as well . Yeah . Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . Okay . Um <disfmarker> What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . because your thumb is slightly up , Mm-hmm . so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to <disfmarker> you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . Slightly curved , curved . the way you h hold of <disfmarker> it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . Okay . I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . Current . I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? True . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think <disfmarker> Yep , I think that's us .
and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . Hmm . I think we have to design one product Huh . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . It's gonna be the same ,
Yeah . Um , think that might appeal <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , Mm . Mm-hmm .
I've not come across anything like that before , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , Video plus . yes . Current . I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . I think that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that sounds a really attractive idea ,
<disfmarker> for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , Yeah . but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . Not for such simple functions Mm . yes okay . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible Simple . Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . Mm . You could have different kind of casings . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . yeah , okay . S So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? Yeah some sort of docking station or <disfmarker> Yes . Rechargeable with a docking station . Mm-hmm . 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . Yeah .
Yeah but um on on that again I just thought <disfmarker> 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is Mm-hmm . Right . so I thought that could be quite a <disfmarker> We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Mm . Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing Mm-hmm . I think that's just general fear of new technology . Yeah ,
So welcome . The first kick-off meeting . What shall we do ? First the opening , then the rest . What are we going to do . We m have to make a new remote control . <vocalsound> It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we'll discuss that later . First we have a look at <gap> .
So we'll discuss that later . First we have a look at <gap> . So first to <disfmarker> we have to make a small painting . What have <disfmarker> do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use <vocalsound> the pen and the eraser . So <disfmarker> Now . <vocalsound> We all have to use this one . You have to make your own favourite animal . <vocalsound> So I'll make an example . Yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um you can change some things . <vocalsound> Um format , line , and change it . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you can change the colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> An elephant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So that's it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So and after it you have to save it . <vocalsound> Okay . Now we can make a new one . You have to paint now . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you're next . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Uh a bird . Is a <disfmarker> It is a <disfmarker> It is a <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Now save ? Yeah . Shit happens . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay . A parrot . Ish . <vocalsound> No , no . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Very good . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . Okay . What are your experiences ? It's easy to you . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 'Kay . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . Okay . This is <disfmarker> It has to be compatible with other things . Yes . Okay . I have one more idea . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Okay . Thank you . Okay .
So <vocalsound> now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So <disfmarker> Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , So that won't be uh our goal , I think . No . And uh g big buttons , <vocalsound> m uh that's easier to use than uh <disfmarker> I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know <disfmarker> Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? Big buttons , positive . Positive . What are your experiences ? Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume . Mm . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it <disfmarker> in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> No no no . But I <disfmarker> my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . It's easy to you . Okay . 'Kay . Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . <vocalsound> Thank you . That's not really ea easy . Help also . <vocalsound> Thank you . So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set .
So next . Hmm . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? <vocalsound> The weight . Not not too heavy . Not too heavy . Not much buttons . Yes . Yeah . Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . Yes . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some <gap> <disfmarker> uh some sort of bleep . <vocalsound> Next . that's <gap> . Yeah well that's <disfmarker> that are good ideas . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah I think it uh <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . Yes . And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . Okay . Just popped up . Yes ? Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't <disfmarker> won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . No battery use .
So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? <vocalsound> The weight . Not not too heavy . Not too heavy . Not much buttons . Yes . Yeah . Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . Yes . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some <gap> <disfmarker> uh some sort of bleep . <vocalsound> Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah I think it uh <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . Yes . And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . Okay . Just popped up . Yes ? Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't <disfmarker> won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . No battery use .
So this is our agenda . You're <disfmarker> F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . Oops . So these are the <disfmarker> Oh , okay . Yeah . So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .
If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report . Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay . Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . Okay , just <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know . Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you <gap> other functions . <vocalsound> It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . Maybe that's better . So this is okay ? <gap> <gap> No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . Okay , Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So <disfmarker> Okay . Ah okay . So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
the best reach place <disfmarker> Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's <vocalsound> basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . Yeah . That's that's below that then . Yeah , okay . It's uh twelve buttons . <gap> just so you get that . I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh <vocalsound> in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . Okay . And also in the num-pads , there's also colour <gap> light behind it . And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? I'll give comments . Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . <vocalsound> Uh the material should be hard plastic . Mm-hmm . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , Um then the elements . Uh we have <disfmarker> The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic . Okay . So you hold it like this in your right hand and <disfmarker> Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? <vocalsound> Speech recognition . Yeah , speech recognition . Just <disfmarker> Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Only one button to say it's on or off . Uh I dunno . Um so I've <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So <disfmarker> But it's enough room . So uh the best <gap> place ,
<vocalsound> Uh the material should be hard plastic . Mm-hmm . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent ,
the best reach place <disfmarker> Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's <vocalsound> basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . Yeah . That's that's below that then . Yeah , okay . It's uh twelve buttons . <gap> just so you get that . So uh the best <gap> place ,
Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh <vocalsound> in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . Okay . And also in the num-pads , there's also colour <gap> light behind it . And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?
What else ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows . Uh menu . Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? Yeah . That's that's very easy , yeah . We can put those here . Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or That's uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> So did we miss anything ? Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . It <disfmarker> Okay . Um <disfmarker> Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be <disfmarker> Okay , maybe we use this button for the <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe Okay . Just make it <disfmarker> There's one text button I prefer . To your video device . Yeah . Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A second level ? Yeah , or th or the <disfmarker> That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Yeah , we have that on the the text button . It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . Yeah . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? Yes , that's to remember . But maybe it's not the way <disfmarker> I dunno if <gap> <disfmarker> That's a functionality for the television . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think as well , but <disfmarker> Uh yeah . No , if i <vocalsound> uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . Yeah , So you have one left for the <disfmarker> So this is the <disfmarker> Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . Yeah . You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? That was it . So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . Uh <disfmarker>
At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . Yeah . Okay , just give it a two . <vocalsound> A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Yeah . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . Yeah . Yeah , but that's unnecessary . What do I think is necessary necessary item ? It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , <vocalsound> it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but <vocalsound> I don't know if it's reachable . Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . Yeah . It's okay . It's cool . I think it's one . Okay , next . This is a difficult one , because we we don't <disfmarker> Yeah , we don't know it about the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> Uh <vocalsound> it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . Yeah . No , but you don't have to use that . Yeah . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Well , I think it is . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . Well y just uh f <vocalsound> And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know <disfmarker> Yep , true . Then a two . Oh . Okay . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> New features . Techno technological innovative ? The speech function and the colour . Colour . <vocalsound> The speech function is new . And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . Slide is not n is is not new . No . It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . But then we also have the the home station . If you have <disfmarker> We are forgetting about that now , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . Home-station . We don't Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but <disfmarker> recharge . Uh all <vocalsound> the the seven , uh all the seven . But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . No , we are not extraordinary new or something . But not <disfmarker> No , just so it's still a two . Tha tha that <disfmarker> So we we are exactly the targeted group . Yeah , but did we reach , um <vocalsound> with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question . I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . Yeah . So we targeted it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . But we didn't follow the latest trends . Yeah . <vocalsound> No . Yeah , you could make a a front Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Like a a f banana kind of front . Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . <vocalsound> No . So we give ourself a three or something . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> Eleven divided by six . Yeah , it is one point eight three . A perfect score . <vocalsound> No , I don't know . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one . Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . <vocalsound> The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our Okay . Okay . These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um <vocalsound> we have to discuss about <vocalsound> , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh <disfmarker> Well I think we do <disfmarker> The LEDs . If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . Yes . Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . Hmm ? The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? Or you haven't thought about <disfmarker> um yeah . Well you didn't say . Ho how do we make uh <disfmarker> Maybe um company colours ? It's black . Yeah , yellow light . A bit a bit of yellow . Can <disfmarker> Make them <disfmarker> No , just make them black or grey or something . Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think . Okay . Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . Well we have changeable fronts , so <disfmarker> Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . So <disfmarker>
Yeah . I did save it . No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . <vocalsound> Mm <vocalsound> okay . Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . Yeah , and single curved curved . But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or <disfmarker> No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be <gap> . Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Probably . I just <disfmarker> The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . So you can put a recharger in it as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But this is expensive , the sample speaker . Yeah . Four . It's four Euros . Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Yeah .
So <gap> I just want you <disfmarker> Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . Okay . Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ? Sure . <vocalsound> Beautiful . Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh <gap> already . So <disfmarker> Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity Yeah . Or a different style . then there <vocalsound> we probably have been creative . I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So it's creativity . Huh . Okay , so the leadership <disfmarker> Was there a leadership and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just normal discussion , I think . Not Yeah . <gap> one leader or something . One leader to check the time , etcetera . <vocalsound> Okay , next one . Uh team work um <disfmarker> The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all <disfmarker> We were not um agree with every not agree with <gap> . Yeah yeah . We were not finished . We're not finished . Uh . Uh I think we <vocalsound> we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Yeah . Yeah . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . Yeah , th that's weird . So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . Yeah . But the teamwork was okay . Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh <disfmarker> I think uh everyone listen to each other . Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . Yeah . No . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Digital pen or <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . Just not work too slow . Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . Yeah , more accurate . Yeah . <gap> Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . Yeah . But you might as well do it in normal computer style . Yeah , In the budget , yeah . New ideas found . New ideas . For for for <disfmarker> I don't know what it mean . Just <disfmarker> I just think if we uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for <disfmarker> I dunno . No , for the prototype . New ideas . Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and <disfmarker> Yeah . But it's for the next team . Yeah , but it <disfmarker> You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . We don't have to do that . That's for <gap> . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the <disfmarker>
Boom-boa-ring-bing . What does it say ? Fill in the questionnaire . What now ? Yes , I think just <disfmarker> I just write a final report . Okay .
Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . <vocalsound> Uh the material should be hard plastic . Mm-hmm . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent ,
That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's <vocalsound> basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . Yeah . That's that's below that then . Yeah , okay . It's uh twelve buttons . <gap> just so you get that .
So uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And h how does the second level come out ? Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . Just uh if you s Uh it slides uh along ? Um slides I think .
So you hold it like this in your right hand and <disfmarker> Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? <vocalsound> Speech recognition . Yeah , speech recognition . Just <disfmarker> Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Only one button to say it's on or off . Uh I dunno . Um so I've <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So <disfmarker> But it's enough room . You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? That was it . So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . Uh <disfmarker>
We're not finished . Uh . Uh I think we <vocalsound> we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Yeah .
<vocalsound> So we are <disfmarker> Yeah , that's included . It's kind of weird that we <vocalsound> we get this information now , afterwards . Okay , then we then we need to use it . Yeah . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . Yeah , th that's weird .
Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . Yeah . No . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Digital pen or <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . Just not work too slow . Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . Yeah , more accurate . Yeah . <gap> Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . Yeah . But you might as well do it in normal computer style . Yeah ,
I take it that you are all ready now . <vocalsound> Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um <vocalsound> which was we got together just to basically decide on <disfmarker> well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , <vocalsound>
okay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well . So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint . <vocalsound> And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be <disfmarker> so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so that's me again . Ah . <vocalsound> Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is <disfmarker> which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of <disfmarker> It wouldn't be very fancy . <vocalsound> You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that <disfmarker> it will give it the energy to work . Mm . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but <disfmarker> Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with <disfmarker> but also using some solar power . Yeah . I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . Okay . Mm . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . Mm . Okay , jolly good . <vocalsound> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where <disfmarker> for example titanium , you can't use it for <disfmarker> if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh <disfmarker>
Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno <disfmarker> it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns <disfmarker> comes on , Hm . Oh , it just gives an answer . a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? <vocalsound> So rubber would be <disfmarker> Okay . I think rubber's <disfmarker> Rubber , we're all we're all going <disfmarker> we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> I mean to certain cues . Oh , then <gap> forget about it . Yeah . Yeah . I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double <disfmarker> rubber double curved case ? <vocalsound> <gap> rubble double double . <vocalsound> We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . <vocalsound> The the <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we're going for the simple buttons . I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . Okay . So rubber rubber keys , yeah . Yeah . Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here Mm . <vocalsound> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? <gap> . It's not actually what you are doing . <vocalsound> But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Y um <vocalsound> what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm <disfmarker> Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . <vocalsound> So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . <vocalsound> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Fo Yeah , yeah . I agree . you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . Yeah . S yeah , push buttons . What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? I think push-buttons is <disfmarker> I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and <disfmarker> S But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh <disfmarker> So that might be an idea of using the rubber , Yeah . But , I mean , it's not <disfmarker> yeah .
But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh <gap> um <disfmarker> you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button <gap> in our last <disfmarker> I can give you an example here of uh , <gap> good layout and bad layout <vocalsound> uh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh Yeah . Yeah . it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . Do we have an uh example of a good one ? And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of <disfmarker> we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . Mm-hmm . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me . The um <disfmarker> The the um the interface type we're going for <disfmarker> So we're <disfmarker> we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . Yeah . Uh . And some sort of <disfmarker> it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . Yeah . you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something <disfmarker> Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , We're <disfmarker> Maybe we can <disfmarker> but um <disfmarker> Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . Let's move over to <disfmarker> I I guess <vocalsound> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . Great . Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Mm . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . <vocalsound> I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh <disfmarker> they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Mm . and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids ,
Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> So next year people will be buying <vocalsound> , Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . Yeah . Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets Mm yeah . I wanna watch the pineapple channel . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is <disfmarker> <gap> . Well spongy , that's where <gap> . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . which we've already probably discussed . Um <vocalsound> the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already <disfmarker> that we already have . So it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah , that's great for us . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So <disfmarker>
like people <disfmarker> and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . Of course , they do . Well , they do , but it's like it's not <disfmarker> Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other But like <disfmarker> Yeah , but , I mean , people like <disfmarker> It would <disfmarker> that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , Well , if you're looking at <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you <gap> looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . Well <disfmarker> An and there is no there is no such thing Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . Okay . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we <disfmarker> maybe we're going in the wrong direction . Maybe we could um <disfmarker> Mm . That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <vocalsound> ,
<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so <vocalsound> anybody can choo like like <gap> <disfmarker> Like the volume buttons should be the <disfmarker> all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different <disfmarker> Yeah . so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , It's um <disfmarker> where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <vocalsound> No vegetables . We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . Some sort . Uh-huh . Or <disfmarker> The power button could be like a big apple or something . Mm .
what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um <vocalsound> is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . Yep .
Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . Yep . Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know <disfmarker> come up with the the user interface design .
Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know <disfmarker> come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices . Alright . Okay . Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . <vocalsound> Oh right . I think , yeah , it's gonna <vocalsound> you know , Mm . come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard .
That sounds good . Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . <vocalsound> Evaluation . you know , s some sort of physical something or other .
we're going for the simple buttons . I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . Okay . So rubber rubber keys , yeah . Yeah .
We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? So rubber would be <disfmarker> Okay . I think rubber's <disfmarker> Rubber , we're all we're all going <disfmarker> we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . <vocalsound> The the <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker>
Yeah , yeah . I agree . you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
so through all that we've <disfmarker> we go we're <disfmarker> right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , <vocalsound> Yep . Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , this <disfmarker> that's that's very good . And then you can market it .
We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . <vocalsound> The the <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker>
The the um the interface type we're going for <disfmarker> So we're <disfmarker> we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . The um <disfmarker>
Hm . Oh , it just gives an answer . a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> I mean to certain cues . Oh , then <gap> forget about it . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . S yeah , push buttons . What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? I think push-buttons is <disfmarker> G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . Well <disfmarker> Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? Mm , I dunno . I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and <disfmarker> S But , I mean , it's not <disfmarker> it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns <disfmarker> comes on ,
Maybe we can <disfmarker> but um <disfmarker> Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . <vocalsound> Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so <vocalsound> anybody can choo like like <gap> <disfmarker> Like the volume buttons should be the <disfmarker> all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different <disfmarker> Yeah . so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , It's um <disfmarker> where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . Yeah . Yeah .
like people <disfmarker> and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . Of course , they do . Well , they do , but it's like it's not <disfmarker> Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other But like <disfmarker> Yeah , but , I mean , people like <disfmarker> It would <disfmarker> that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , Well , if you're looking at <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you <gap> looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . Well <disfmarker> An and there is no there is no such thing Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , Maybe we could um <disfmarker> Mm . That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <vocalsound> ,
<vocalsound> Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . <vocalsound> Mm . and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <vocalsound> No vegetables . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . Some sort . Uh-huh . Or <disfmarker> The power button could be like a big apple or something . Mm .
I'll help talk . <vocalsound> Um yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , <vocalsound> yeah , uh unit price <disfmarker> unit production price cost thing . Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the <vocalsound> the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? Yeah . Scrolling through your favourites list . Oh okay okay . Ah 'kay . <vocalsound> I like the the the the logo on there as well . It's very prominent <vocalsound> . So <vocalsound> here I'll give you the <disfmarker> so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is <disfmarker> or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? This is the teletext . Start s the yeah the programme button . Ah , okay I see . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <vocalsound> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this <disfmarker> of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . So you can see that when it lays like this or like this <disfmarker> It's pretty cool . and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um <disfmarker> Is that <disfmarker> could that be easy to <disfmarker> for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it <disfmarker> Not helping <vocalsound> . Mm . Feels good . <vocalsound> I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . Yeah of course . You have to reach a little bit don't you . Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> Uh pla Exactly that's exactly what those are for . Ah okay okay . And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , <vocalsound> we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> it's the right shape isn't it ? it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <disfmarker> But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , Mm . Right . 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides <gap> . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but <disfmarker> Okay . Uh , I can see that . But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , Mm-hmm . Oh no this is <vocalsound> just what we had to work with at the time . Okay . So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . The <disfmarker> hmm . I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . <vocalsound> My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . <vocalsound> we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> the characteristics I talk about ,
we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> the characteristics I talk about , Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> Uh pla Yeah <vocalsound> it's the right shape isn't it ? it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <disfmarker>
Exactly that's exactly what those are for . Ah okay okay . And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , <vocalsound> we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> it's the right shape isn't it ? it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <disfmarker> But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , Mm .
we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about <disfmarker> we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of <disfmarker> the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? Um so <vocalsound> yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w Do you <disfmarker> would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh <disfmarker> there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c <vocalsound> one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my <disfmarker> but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . <vocalsound> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . Hmm . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <vocalsound> <disfmarker> W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less <disfmarker> b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . Now now . <vocalsound> So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . Have you ? Okay . Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . Oh I see I see . <gap> . <vocalsound> So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh <disfmarker> we got <vocalsound> basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the <vocalsound> what we call you know the the <vocalsound> the corp corporate <disfmarker> Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think <vocalsound> we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , It fell off .
We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of <disfmarker> the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh <disfmarker> there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c <vocalsound> one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my <disfmarker> but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . <vocalsound> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . Hmm . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <vocalsound> <disfmarker> W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less <disfmarker> b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .
is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? It's a scroll . That's a scroll . Just a scroll ? Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . I <vocalsound> I think we we ended up being quite creative there . We got a couple innovative i Mm there's a risk of that . But anyway that's uh <disfmarker> Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us where <disfmarker> I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . Uh-huh . Uh <vocalsound> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Can be made for <disfmarker> it sounded different that time <disfmarker> uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , Oh , sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh do you think that's fair coming from a <disfmarker> m the manufacturing ? Yeah um I do think we that we we <vocalsound> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , <gap> . So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . And we and we have a single-curved uh <disfmarker> Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? Uh I think that <disfmarker> I'm <gap> convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come <disfmarker> bring it down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Fifteen point four . See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it <vocalsound> . Ah . What do you know <vocalsound> . But the the the <disfmarker> we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th <vocalsound> Oh it's <vocalsound> a that's not very special , it's pretty <disfmarker> if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> O okay so we're <disfmarker> Push-button , scroll wheel , we're <disfmarker> basically we have uh th We don't <disfmarker>
clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , Coulda been worse . Okay <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> Are the costs within the budget ? <vocalsound> Mm n <vocalsound> no . We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul <vocalsound> the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us <vocalsound> , and we can use that to tell <disfmarker> How's it going ? <vocalsound> Anyone got any thoughts ? What ? How how have we done today ? I think we did pretty well . Yeah . I think we did pretty well too . That looks pretty spectacular . No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . Any other chang uh thoughts ? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? <vocalsound> That was mm-hmm <disfmarker> Is it the <gap> . Sh I think there was plenty of room . Yeah . I <vocalsound> I think we we ended up being quite creative there . We got a couple innovative i well we we we kinda broke <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Couple innovative ideas . we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , Uh no <vocalsound> yeah but <disfmarker> we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh <disfmarker> 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Yep . What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . These cables suck <vocalsound> . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh dear <vocalsound> . No more pizza for me <vocalsound> . We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur I don't know whether that <vocalsound> . It's single-curved , You think ? <vocalsound> So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 'Cause this is <disfmarker> you were using it o upside down . Not the original budget , but they are now . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . <vocalsound> What new ideas have we found ? Oh wel And the costs within the budget ? Well let's do both then . Uh for the product ? Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . Oh . Is the project evaluated ? And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more <disfmarker> Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . Yeah less sore on the ears .
Is it the <gap> . Sh I think there was plenty of room . Yeah . well we we we kinda broke <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Couple innovative ideas . we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , Yep . Uh no <vocalsound> yeah but <disfmarker> we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh <disfmarker> 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was That was mm-hmm <disfmarker>
So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 'Cause this is <disfmarker> you were using it o upside down . clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about .

It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . These cables suck <vocalsound> . Mm . And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more <disfmarker> Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . Yeah less sore on the ears .
Coulda been worse . Okay <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> Are the costs within the budget ? <vocalsound> Mm n <vocalsound> no . And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ?
And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ?
<vocalsound> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh <disfmarker> there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together .

Uh , uh , um . I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead . Okay . <vocalsound> I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um <vocalsound> sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , That's about it . <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm <disfmarker> I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . Yeah . And uh the detailed design <disfmarker> in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . <vocalsound>
Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . <vocalsound> Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a <disfmarker> not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . <vocalsound> Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um .
functional design um . Um do we have <disfmarker> um any ideas of of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just <disfmarker> you know , change channels is its main function . So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or <disfmarker> I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote 'Kay . products in in one person's house . Mm . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . 'Kay . I think they all work on the same prin principle as well Mm . <vocalsound> I think we're all in the same boat here . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . Okay . Mm . So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . Ch So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh Like a tracking device ? <vocalsound> like a tracking device Oh you can get those key <disfmarker> or or like a a <disfmarker> well you could whistle or make a noise It makes a noise , and it'd beep . there's a button on the T_V_ that you press Mm , mm . Be good . So <disfmarker> Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . Yeah . Just long . Do we want <disfmarker> so they're kinda like long and rectangular . <vocalsound> Yeah . Do we want something crazy ? Black usually . You know , Yeah . we want something new that's gonna stand out . Lot more modern . I think so . A m a modern <disfmarker> so our remote should be <disfmarker> Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . <vocalsound> Maybe like user-friendly , like a little Yeah . you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . People <disfmarker> Mm . I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another <disfmarker> if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . 'Kay . Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , Yeah . so there are always the <disfmarker> some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . Mm . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer so we want it to be sturdy , Yeah . we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , Yeah . It could be cased on the outside then it <disfmarker> and t everything could be inside . 'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um <disfmarker>
What else <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . Mm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . 'Kay . you know , how <disfmarker> maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <vocalsound> remote control out there . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'Kay . just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something <disfmarker> maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .
Right . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , <gap> I'd <disfmarker> I could draw sorta the ball idea . you know , My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you <disfmarker> this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle <disfmarker> Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that <disfmarker> if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um <disfmarker> the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , Yeah . but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , Yeah . That's one of the big issues . Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's that's <vocalsound> interesting of course , that was just one idea though . but that's of course a weak point , yeah . Yeah . How would we go about um making you know <disfmarker> getting rid of our weak points ? What <disfmarker> I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? <vocalsound> well maybe <disfmarker> I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . Okay . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . Well But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , <vocalsound> Yeah . It's not new , it's not innovative , it's <disfmarker> you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , no , go ahead . My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games Yeah . But maybe <disfmarker> I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . is a good idea . Mm . I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <vocalsound> suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . Something with a grip . Yeah , with a grip . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because even <disfmarker> I suppose even with the ball It still might be hard to <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . Mm . So perhaps the the joystick <disfmarker> the the keyboard idea might work better . Like <disfmarker> yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . Mm . if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's <disfmarker> Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um <disfmarker> say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so So the grip is <disfmarker> No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then <vocalsound> flat uh <disfmarker> And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? Mm , that's true . Okay , so then we forget the ball . <vocalsound> It looks cool . <vocalsound> but it's really not <disfmarker> it's not functional um . Uh <vocalsound> functional . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , Right . Right . But it's one-handed um . Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , Mm . makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not <disfmarker> probably not get a get away from some longer design . Yeah . <vocalsound> because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . right , and <disfmarker> Batteries go weak as well , so um So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work . I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . More expensive and <disfmarker> yeah . but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , Put it <disfmarker> you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of <disfmarker> or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . Even if you designed it <disfmarker> in some <disfmarker> in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle ,
you know , how <disfmarker> maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <vocalsound> remote control out there . <vocalsound> Yeah .
Must finish now , so . T And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . Mm .
um and you know , What else <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros
Okay , so then we forget the ball . <vocalsound> It looks cool . <vocalsound>
Yeah . but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , Yeah . How would we go about um making you know <disfmarker> getting rid of our weak points ? What <disfmarker> I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? <vocalsound> so there are always the <disfmarker> some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . Well Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um <disfmarker> the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really ,
That's one of the big issues . Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's that's <vocalsound> interesting of course , that was just one idea though . but that's of course a weak point , yeah . Yeah . and then <vocalsound> flat uh <disfmarker> And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? Mm , that's true . where maybe you <disfmarker> this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle <disfmarker> Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that <disfmarker> if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts ,
Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . Yeah . so they're kinda like long and rectangular . <vocalsound> Yeah . Do we want something crazy ? Black usually . You know , Yeah . we want something new that's gonna stand out . Lot more modern . I think so . A m a modern <disfmarker> so our remote should be <disfmarker> Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . <vocalsound> So the grip is <disfmarker> No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom Okay , so then we forget the ball . <vocalsound> It looks cool . <vocalsound> but it's really not <disfmarker> it's not functional um . Uh <vocalsound> functional . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , <vocalsound> Yeah . It's not new , it's not innovative , it's <disfmarker> you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , go ahead . My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games Yeah . Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , <gap> I'd <disfmarker> Yeah , with a grip . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because even <disfmarker> I suppose even with the ball It still might be hard to <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . Mm . So perhaps the the joystick <disfmarker> the the keyboard idea might work better . Like <disfmarker> Be good . So <disfmarker>
So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ? Ninja Homer , made in Japan . <vocalsound> Um , there are a few changes we've made . Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , Okay . so instead we've um <disfmarker> this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button . Mm 'kay . Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . Where are they ? Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? Ah , right . So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker> Right . Right , 'kay . Okay cool . It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . Okay and what is this here ? Cool . That's a number pad . Okay so the number pad is <disfmarker> Where are we gonna have the slogan ? 'Kay , great . Um they're al along this <disfmarker> You know , just like right inside there . Yeah . So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger Mm-hmm . so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap> Okay . Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . about yeah nine total . So we're talking about ten centimetres . That sounds good . Yeah . Is these are these the colours that <disfmarker> of production , or is this just what we had available ? Well I'm <disfmarker> We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . Right . could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . But um <vocalsound> this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . <vocalsound> Excuse me . Mm-hmm . Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Sure . so that's like an okay button , right . Mm-hmm . Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <vocalsound> I don't know . I don't think five is <disfmarker> Um . be about th three and a half . Okay . So you can power on and off , Three and a half . what else can you do ? Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . Okay . Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . Okay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? Mm-hmm . Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <disfmarker> Contrast , colour , sharpness . Sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . Mm-hmm . ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ? Audio . Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . Um . Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes ,
Mm . <vocalsound> or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . No can do . Yeah Um we have um got some push buttons as well . Or even clear . We've got push buttons as well . Like uh oh wait I'm not sure if that counts but <disfmarker> Okay . Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . Okay . That is one . One . The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you I g I guess that's it , so we can now um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to Mm-hmm . um if we need to rethink anything at all . So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? The battery . um what about the electronics here ? Yeah advanced chip . We need an advanced chip I think , yep . Advanced chip . Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . Mm-hmm .
Anything I've missed ? No . Okay Mm . so they're s Yep . Say a button's about Looks good . say a button's about this size , right , Yep . so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yep . Clunky , okay . That sounds good . Yeah . That would be good . Yep . So ten centimetres in height . Nine , ten . Yep . Okay um <vocalsound> . Yeah about three , okay . three ? Yep . Okay , um <disfmarker> like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , Yep . Mm-hmm . Yep . Mm-hmm . Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? Yep . Yep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? The battery . Do we have kinetic as well ? No . No . Okay , just battery . We need an <disfmarker> And that's because of cost restraints is it ? Yep . Yeah . Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so . Yep . Okay um So we want double-curved ? Yep . Okay . Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . Okay , Um . um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? Yep . So I'll have to put that <disfmarker> Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , Yep . I dunno the <gap> <disfmarker> Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . Okay . Yep . And it helps you to understand How about these ? Are we wanting them in <disfmarker> No . no they're just <disfmarker> is everything gonna be plastic ? Yep . Yep . Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> Yep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . Um take away the L_C_ display ? Yep . And the advanced chip goes away as well . Regular chip . regular chip . Yep . Mm-hmm . That's it . I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , Mm-hmm . Yep . Right . Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . <vocalsound> Sort of flat as possible . You see I envision it as being um quite deep
Okay , um <vocalsound> control <disfmarker> high tech innovation . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , Mm . but jog-dial 's good . but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . Okay , Yeah about three , okay . three ? Okay , um <disfmarker> Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . I shouldn't have said colour , but just <disfmarker> Lemon . Well that's kind of <disfmarker> Okay , the blue the blue colours and <disfmarker> don't re don't actually represent the colour , Yeah . Right . Yeah , could be . Yeah . Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , couldn't it ? Okay so we'll go two . <vocalsound> Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . Well yeah , F f yeah f fairly basic , isn't it ? I mean I'd give that nearly a one . you guys think ? Yeah , one ? Okay . <vocalsound> The idea is that I've set up <disfmarker> I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Um , <vocalsound> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . Yeah I think it's about five . Five ? so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um <disfmarker> sort of review where we stand with it . Okay , so um <disfmarker> So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . Mm 'kay . So these i these i th are the <disfmarker> and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so yeah . Okay . Okay ? So the first one uh , stylish look and feel . I rate that pretty highly . Well yeah , Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? Yep . like there or something ? Huh . And um it's within budget , yep . It is , isn't it ? Okay let's go with five then . Okay . Okay , it's upside-down . Let's go with two point five then . <vocalsound>
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 'S pretty good . So it's pretty good . Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . Out of forty nine , I guess . Yeah ,
<vocalsound> unsupportive ? I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . Mm . Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss Mm-hmm . Yeah . and and and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just <disfmarker> we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know , So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? Think could be , yeah . I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , Yeah . Yeah , yeah . and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . Yeah . And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally , Yeah . as opposed to having to present them . Yeah . What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? <vocalsound> Yep clunky . <vocalsound> Sure , yeah . Oh they're a bit clunky . Agreed . <vocalsound> Mm . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , <vocalsound> Hmm . and haven't done that since . But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , Yeah , mm-hmm , So I think the pen's good . yeah . It's about the best thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . Yeah . Yeah we only needed one computer and <disfmarker> We only actually needed one computer . Yeah , that's true . If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . Good point . And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , Yeah . could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . Mm . if we just had uh <disfmarker> that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about <disfmarker> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c Mm-hmm . maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . Mm-hmm . Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . Hmm . Play-Doh s No it is it is . It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . Huh . Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . Did they ? . Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . 'Kay I'm I'm listening My leg . <vocalsound> Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or not those four points , my four points , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . It becomes tangible . Mm-hmm . whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? d debating <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . I think it means like you know <disfmarker> Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , Mm . So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , Okay . so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker> You feel like you're caged within whatever y <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . The constraints do come in very fast . Okay uh do you know what , So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , Yeah . And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , Yeah . and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker> Yeah , sure . it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . New creativity . Mm . Mm-hmm . and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker> Okay . you know , innovative thought with . <vocalsound> In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker> Uh-huh , okay . But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free <disfmarker> So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . Yeah maybe not co confining . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Okay . I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , Mm-hmm . Okay , uh what about teamwork ? Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . Yeah .
I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation Mm . they're still very individual tools . Yeah , could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . Mm . if we just had uh <disfmarker> that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . <vocalsound> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c Mm-hmm . uh what about teamwork ? Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . Yeah . Yeah . If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . Yeah . Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , Mm . So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , Okay . so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker> You feel like you're caged within whatever y I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . The constraints do come in very fast . Okay uh do you know what , in it <disfmarker> So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . Yeah .
Anything I've missed ? No . Okay Mm . so they're s Yep . Say a button's about Looks good . say a button's about this size , right , Yep . so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yep . Clunky , okay . That sounds good . Yeah . That would be good . Yep . So ten centimetres in height . Nine , ten . Yep . Okay um <vocalsound> . Yeah about three , okay . three ? Yep . Okay , um <disfmarker> like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , Yep . Mm-hmm . Yep . Mm-hmm . Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? Yep . Yep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? The battery . Do we have kinetic as well ? No . No . Okay , just battery . We need an <disfmarker> And that's because of cost restraints is it ? Yep . Yeah . Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so . Yep . Okay um So we want double-curved ? Yep . Okay . um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? Yep . So I'll have to put that <disfmarker> Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , Yep . I dunno the <gap> <disfmarker> Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . Okay . Yep . And it helps you to understand How about these ? Are we wanting them in <disfmarker> No . no they're just <disfmarker> is everything gonna be plastic ? Yep . Yep . Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> Yep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . Um take away the L_C_ display ? Yep . And the advanced chip goes away as well . Regular chip . regular chip . Yep . Mm-hmm . I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . Yep . Right . <vocalsound> Sort of flat as possible . You see I envision it as being um quite deep
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you That is one . One .
So we want double-curved ? Yep . Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .
Um we have um got some push buttons as well . Or even clear . We've got push buttons as well . Like uh oh wait
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you That is one . One .
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , Mm-hmm . so we may not need to <disfmarker> Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm . That's it . Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,
Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , It just occurred to me that they all <disfmarker> or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . No can do . Yeah we could just go with um <disfmarker> Yeah we only needed one computer and <disfmarker> Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . Or <disfmarker> Yeah Evaluation . Mm . So , Yeah it's not very tangible . sort of <vocalsound> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . Yeah . Yeah that's what I was thinking , to I dunno like a six or something . Yeah . Yeah What does anybody else think ? Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif then um <disfmarker> because when you put it on the shelf <disfmarker> What about button shape ? Square buttons ?
Yep . Okay . So we're w w quite far over . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now we're gonna <disfmarker> something's gonna have to go . Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker> Uh how mm-hmm <disfmarker>
Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . Mm . Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , 'Kay .
Yeah ? Okay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people <vocalsound> fifteen people in each group . Okay . <vocalsound> So we got <disfmarker> some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . <vocalsound> Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . And if they do , not very often . Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button ,
you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because <vocalsound> if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . <vocalsound> However , <vocalsound> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could <disfmarker> there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , <vocalsound> I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , Mm-hmm . If you could uh do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Finally , my opinion . Yep . The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many ,
Um but uh the pro <vocalsound> I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from <vocalsound> want it to do most . So , something that's uh <vocalsound> something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . Um so that those are then immediately <vocalsound> accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp <vocalsound> you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's <vocalsound> going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually <gap> a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , Okay , this is a <vocalsound> brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I <vocalsound> had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , Okay . press on . I've looked at <vocalsound> looked at a num <vocalsound> uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . <vocalsound> Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand <disfmarker> and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what <vocalsound> what is most likely to get used . Um <vocalsound> With uh <disfmarker> a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you <vocalsound> if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ <vocalsound> D_V_D_ or uh <vocalsound> V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um . My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design .
Okay . Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . Um , <vocalsound> , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . Mm-hmm . don't worry about it at all mate . <vocalsound> Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that . Okay . Well .
Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you <disfmarker> tell you where it is . I had one of those , Mm , yeah , I've seen them . and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up Um . Well because it it went off all the time accidentally . the other option of course is that um the The clapping one . <vocalsound> well <disfmarker> I was going to say clapping , um <disfmarker> Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has <disfmarker> of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . To a television . <vocalsound> Mm . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . Yeah . Yeah , that's a good idea . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't <disfmarker> power <gap> that might be something that we could look into . Yeah <vocalsound> it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . <vocalsound> I think so , yeah . along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about <vocalsound> um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . <vocalsound> The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . Cost . Mm . but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . 'Kay . Um that's just my view right now , Mm . <vocalsound> however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , Mm . Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <vocalsound> a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , Mm . traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , That could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels <disfmarker> Mm . <gap> I I was thinking that the remote <vocalsound> the um <vocalsound> sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . We <disfmarker> Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it Yeah . Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . <vocalsound> I would agree with you . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development Um , I mean Mm . I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . Mm-hmm . Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . Mm-hmm . So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i <vocalsound> you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and <vocalsound> fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra <gap>
Just a thought . <vocalsound> Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um <disfmarker> There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , Mm-hmm . but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are <disfmarker> niche are we trying to market and corner . for whom is this intended ? <vocalsound> I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . Most people , yeah . Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . Mm . Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . <gap> getting the external power source ,
<vocalsound> The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? Yeah , think so . <vocalsound> Do you mind looking <gap> ? The ability to locate it again . Yeah . So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and <vocalsound> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . Light bulb as well , Oh . So <vocalsound> so no ? Sorry ? a small speaker you mean . Speaker <vocalsound> those little key-rings have both , so <disfmarker> th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . Yeah . by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . Because we're only going to have a very few key I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . Mm-hmm . So . To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going <disfmarker> uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . Mm yeah . Yeah , I think that's <disfmarker> Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? We could use say the left and right for changing channels Yeah . Right . So I should just look at um the speaker , <gap> the speaker and an L_E_D_ . <vocalsound> well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved , Actually how <disfmarker> but navigation around a menu for most things . Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the <disfmarker> y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . Okay . And that's really irritating . Mm-hmm .
discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues .
Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable ,
um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable ,
well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what
well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what
well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what
maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved ,
So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? Yeah , think so . <vocalsound> Do you mind looking <gap> ?
you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because <vocalsound> if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . <vocalsound> However , <vocalsound> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could <disfmarker> there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , <vocalsound> I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , Mm-hmm . If you could uh do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible .

Finally , my opinion . Yep . The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . how many ,
Mm . Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <vocalsound> a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , Mm . traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , <gap> I I was thinking that the remote <vocalsound> the um <vocalsound> sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels .

Mm yeah . uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i <vocalsound> you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and <vocalsound> fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra <gap>
I would say that the design spec we've been <gap> with is for the television only for now . Mm-hmm . <gap> concern about our market . Um , if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of <gap> remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , Yeah . Mm-hmm . you want one wo <vocalsound> y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Mm-hmm . this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , mm . <vocalsound> Does that um would that include um access to say <vocalsound> interactive functions on digital or cable ? <vocalsound> Yeah . I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it <disfmarker>
The ability to locate it again . Yeah . So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and <vocalsound> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . Light bulb as well , Oh . So <vocalsound> so no ? Sorry ? a small speaker you mean . Speaker <vocalsound> those little key-rings have both , so <disfmarker> because it it went off all the time accidentally . the other option of course is that um the The clapping one . <vocalsound> well <disfmarker> I was going to say clapping , um <disfmarker> Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has <disfmarker> of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . To a television . <vocalsound> Mm . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . Yeah . Yeah , that's a good idea . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't <disfmarker> power <gap> th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . Yeah .
We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um we will do the <disfmarker> this is prototype presentation . So , Okay . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button .
Okay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to <disfmarker> one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . Okay . Um , <vocalsound> is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . uh just pop in at any time . Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh <disfmarker> So um <disfmarker> You put it uh <disfmarker> you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . Mm-hmm . And you <disfmarker> But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . Oh yeah ? But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . So I'm wondering if we if we neely <disfmarker> really need all of those buttons . <vocalsound> I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . <vocalsound> And well Yeah . the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . Yeah . Yeah . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . Yeah . The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary Yeah yeah . because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . Mm . Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh <disfmarker> Long time . Yeah . Okay . Well , <vocalsound> you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . So it's rather basic already . Yeah . Think so . It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . Yeah . Yeah , Just n normal plain buttons . it <disfmarker> But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay . So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . Nay . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . True . True .
That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . <vocalsound> Mm . If we see <disfmarker> I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . Since it rechargeable . It's rechargeable . That's right . u just uh <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . That's two Euros off . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh <vocalsound> to save there . Yep . <vocalsound> Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , Mm . I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . Yeah . I think we have to keep that . Yeah . Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Okay . Because you have to <disfmarker> we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , so if we <disfmarker> Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Uh <disfmarker> Sixteen , I believe so . Eighteen Euros . So , Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button . seventeen . Yeah . Uh seventeen . <vocalsound> I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . <gap> .
but then you you can push uh some other button as well . But <disfmarker> Yeah . You could just not scroll for a half a second . Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . So you won't need a button . Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . No remote . <vocalsound> Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Scroll-wheel's one . But how does scroll-wheel work here ? Then you will <disfmarker> Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . Yeah . That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Alright . Mm . Okay
But <disfmarker> Can we use <disfmarker> can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? I think so . Yeah . Uh , yeah . Holding a remote with <vocalsound> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . No . <vocalsound> With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . Yeah . Uh seventeen . <vocalsound> I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . <gap> . We could make two buttons out of that . And just um <disfmarker> If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . Yeah . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . More obvious . So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . So No . That wouldn't be an option . And this is <disfmarker> Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . Yeah . That's right . And it sh So we can decrease this one to four buttons . Yeah ?
Yeah . Ah . So maybe we should just re-focus . Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . You can do more .
Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . No remote . <vocalsound> Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Scroll-wheel's one . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . Yeah . Uh seventeen . <vocalsound> I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . <gap> . That's possibility as well .
Our fourth and last meeting . There he is . Yes . Okay But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . No . This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . No . <vocalsound> No . But we can go on with the project evaluation . Uh yes . What ? 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Uh yeah . Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is <disfmarker> If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and now we don't need uh LEDs or um <disfmarker> Y uh No . s some uh remote controls uh do it also , No . but um uh because we use the little display Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . Mm . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . 'Kay . Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? I think it's fancy . Yeah . Six . Uh six . Yeah . We all go for six ? Good . Um , is the design innovative ? Very . <vocalsound> Mm . Sh I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . <vocalsound> Seven . Seven ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Should be do-able . Yeah . That's right . Is the design easy to use ? Mm . Not really . That's a bit dodgy . but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . Yeah . Yes . I think we have to keep that . I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . Four or five . Yes . Yeah . Is it functional ? Is the design functional ? <vocalsound> Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? No . No . No . I don't think so . It's pretty slim . Think it's uh seven . Seven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and <disfmarker> R_S_I_ influences ? Mm m Mm , we haven't thought of that one . It was . Think we do . I had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Yeah . Well <vocalsound> they are now . Yeah . <vocalsound> Does the design fit the group of focus ? I think that's a three . Mm , th yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better . I think it doesn't . I don't know . s But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I still <disfmarker> I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . I think <disfmarker> Yeah . I would give it a four . I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two . I go for three . Well , we have the logo there . Yeah . We're gonna go to our other room again . Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No . Nine ? Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . <vocalsound> Minus four . No but I think <disfmarker> Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . Yes . Uh that's that's a big cost . So that would be minus eight . Forty one out of forty nine . Forty one . That's <disfmarker> Around eighty percent . Okay . Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . Which isn't the <disfmarker> the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . No . So I think that's a pretty nice score . Hmm . Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? <vocalsound> Along the process ? Yes . Yeah . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ? No . <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah . No . Well , Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Faster as well , I think . Yes . Yeah . <gap> . Pen is here . Yes . Uh , network . But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . No . Yeah . Holding a remote with <vocalsound> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . No . <vocalsound> That's eighty four percent .
Yeah . And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . Yeah . 'Kay . Is the company company recognisable ? Yes it is . Yeah yeah .
So , that brings us to the project evaluation . Yep . <vocalsound> Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? <vocalsound> Along the process ? Yes . Yeah . But it <disfmarker> Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . Yeah . That's right . So lack of information about prices . Yeah . Definitely . The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step
Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ? No . <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not too much . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh <disfmarker> Yeah , true . The room was <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . <gap> . And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . Mm . 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you <disfmarker> two of you with the uh last phase ? So <disfmarker>
That's okay . Okay . <vocalsound> I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . Okay . Okay . Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . Yeah . Questionnaire . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . Where's the champagne ?
Yeah . Freek , what do you think ? Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design .
But <disfmarker> Can we use <disfmarker> can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? I think so . Yeah . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . More obvious . So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . So
If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . True . True . But how does scroll-wheel work here ? Then you will <disfmarker> Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
Yeah . Ah . So maybe we should just re-focus . Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . You can do more .
Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features . Nay . Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I'd rather just go to the board I'm ag and get us to spend <vocalsound> eighteen dollars a a remote . Ask for more money .
That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? <vocalsound> Only the docking station , I guess . Yeah . Which isn't the <disfmarker> the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . No . So it's not even taken into the price . That's extra . <vocalsound> That's extra .
But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . No . This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . Yeah . It will . Yeah . <vocalsound> But um <disfmarker> 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . No , Yeah . So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . I think the most <disfmarker> But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . Yeah . Okay . But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . No . Yeah . Holding a remote with <vocalsound> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . No . <vocalsound> With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple .
With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Yeah . It will . Yeah . 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . No , Yeah . So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . I think the most <disfmarker> But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . Yeah . Okay . But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . No .
Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . Yeah , Too great for email then . Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . Yeah . Mm . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very <disfmarker> has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . Um . Yeah . So I <disfmarker> so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful move to next s slide . <vocalsound> So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller <vocalsound> which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So <disfmarker> That's the end of the talk <vocalsound> the end of the presentation . <vocalsound> So you propose to to have the Uh <disfmarker> remote control which will be powerful . With sophisticated functions , but with very <disfmarker> many functions Yes . and very easy to use . Yep . So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , To merge the two system huh . I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple Yeah . But But this is <disfmarker> But if we have very very good user interface Yeah . it take less time for user to learn how to use it . Yeah ,
So you think that uh <vocalsound> a cable between the remote control <vocalsound> and the T_V_ <vocalsound> <disfmarker> won't be a good idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No it wou maybe it will be cheaper <vocalsound> I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu because you know . Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? Uh , <vocalsound> I don't <vocalsound> think it will be too much . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Could you answer please ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Have to think about the question , you know , So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . Mm-hmm . Mm . I propose a nifra infrared base <vocalsound> you know , so so I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? I think it's cheaper than laser , so <vocalsound> . Yeah . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? You can go to the next slide . Okay . I have some kind of pictures you know , Yeah . Yeah . I think it's would be easier to have <vocalsound> a link between the remote control and the television , Well you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . it is the last one it's <disfmarker> So it's <disfmarker> I think it should be wire <vocalsound> wireless re remote con <vocalsound> Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire <vocalsound> with remote control ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'd <disfmarker>
because now everybody has internet at home , Mm-hmm . so it's better to use internet then teletext . Yeah . Okay <vocalsound> . Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , The look , how it look like . Okay . Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so <disfmarker> doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . Uh , so as you said uh , Mm-hmm . remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . <vocalsound> so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . <vocalsound> What is R_S_I_ ? R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um <disfmarker> doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . <vocalsound> Yeah . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , Functions . So <disfmarker> Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? Yeah . Sure ? Yeah ? Yeah , I think possible . Because we can <disfmarker> We can uh mix uh several function in one button . Yeah . So lets you <disfmarker> then you have less buttons . Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? But I'm not sure <disfmarker> Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . Yeah , No you you can have a switch menu , so you can Yeah , well but it has to be intuitive . for example <disfmarker> then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . With a <disfmarker> So we can has less buttons . Yeah , But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny <disfmarker> look fancy , not funny . but <disfmarker> <gap> This is a question that should be asked to the <disfmarker> If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people <gap> . Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . Yeah . But this was first step and <disfmarker> This was the first step , yeah . I think the solution is to have many colours of <disfmarker> you know instead of having one grey standard <disfmarker> Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . Specially distribution , yeah . but this is what we would ask to the users , so . And also f Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , Yeah . and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . Mm-hmm .
I think it would be simpler . I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , Mm-hmm . because if you want to sale <disfmarker> to sell the remote control . It's okay ? Regarding the first line , what <disfmarker> So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . Yeah . And that's it . yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , Mm-hmm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , Yep . and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not <disfmarker> you won't be uh <disfmarker> you won't had <vocalsound> um buttons to just to manipulate <disfmarker> yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . Control . Mm-hmm . to do remote control Mm . which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost . So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . Yeah . Okay . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . Mm-hmm . So . and uh also <disfmarker> So has to be yellow . Yeah . Yellow . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . Okay . Mm-hmm . Require lot of requirements , but <disfmarker> It's already changed for <disfmarker>
I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . Why you go <disfmarker> It has to be fashion . Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , Okay . Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . Yeah , Yeah . A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . Okay . It's It's not so uh popular now . <vocalsound> It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know So I I so <disfmarker> As as for the colour , what what do you think ? I think it has to be yellow . <vocalsound> Yellow ?
Uh <disfmarker> Y you <disfmarker> You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um <disfmarker> pon Industrial Designer , yeah . Industrial Designer . Component component , yeah . yeah ,
Okay . Component component , yeah . yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
okay . last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent ,
Okay . Mm-hmm . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , Functions .
so it's better to use internet then teletext . Yeah . so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , Mm-hmm . yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , Mm-hmm .
you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , Yep . and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not <disfmarker> you won't be uh <disfmarker> you won't had <vocalsound> um buttons to just to manipulate <disfmarker> yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . Control .
Yeah . Okay . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . Mm-hmm . So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
Yeah . Okay . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . Mm-hmm . So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . Okay .
So you think that uh <vocalsound> a cable between the remote control <vocalsound> and the T_V_ <vocalsound> <disfmarker> won't be a good idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No it wou maybe it will be cheaper <vocalsound> I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu because you know . Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? Uh , <vocalsound> I don't <vocalsound> think it will be too much . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Could you answer please ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Have to think about the question , you know , but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . Mm-hmm . I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? Yeah . Yeah . I think it's would be easier to have <vocalsound> a link between the remote control and the television , Well it is the last one it's <disfmarker> So it's <disfmarker> I think it should be wire <vocalsound> wireless re remote con <vocalsound> Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire <vocalsound> with remote control ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'd <disfmarker>
So <disfmarker> Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? Yeah . Sure ? Yeah ? Yeah , I think possible . Because we can <disfmarker> We can uh mix uh several function in one button . Yeah . So lets you <disfmarker> then you have less buttons . Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? But I'm not sure <disfmarker> Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . Yeah , No you you can have a switch menu , so you can Yeah , well but it has to be intuitive . for example <disfmarker> then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . With a <disfmarker> and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . Mm-hmm .
I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . Why you go <disfmarker> It has to be fashion . Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , Okay . But this was first step and <disfmarker> This was the first step , yeah . I think the solution is to have many colours of <disfmarker> you know instead of having one grey standard <disfmarker> Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . Specially distribution , yeah . but this is what we would ask to the users , so . And also f Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , Yeah . So I I so <disfmarker> As as for the colour , what what do you think ? I think it has to be yellow . <vocalsound> Yellow ?
I received an email as well . So we're going to talk about the conceptual model . <vocalsound> Oh . Uh okay . So <disfmarker> Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . <gap> What's it called , just tell us . Okay , we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um <disfmarker> It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?
Okay . So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your <disfmarker> No . Okay well <disfmarker> I received an email <disfmarker> Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . <vocalsound> The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh <disfmarker> This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . Hmm . But um <vocalsound> this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . But we already have the flashing flashing light on the <disfmarker> features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . Yeah . So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari <vocalsound> uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . Hmm . But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Spongy . Spongy , like sponge . Spongy . Okay . <vocalsound> So rubber , kind of . Uh soft materials . Yeah . But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . Yeah , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means Soft , sponge . So it's also a stress-ball . That's a good <disfmarker> That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah . Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . <vocalsound> And uh some basic uh colour fronts . <vocalsound> Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . <vocalsound> Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . Yeah ,
Uh it came out of the research . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . Hmm . But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Spongy . Spongy , like sponge . Spongy . Okay . <vocalsound> So rubber , kind of . Uh soft materials . Yeah . But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . Yeah , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means Soft , sponge . So it's also a stress-ball . That's a good <disfmarker> That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .
And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So The display requires an advanced chip . Okay . And speech recognition ? Yeah , probably too . Advanced <gap> . Yeah . I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> It's very uh difficult to to to do it . Intro Yeah . Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . Yeah , Well , that's the problem . That's the main problem . I got f also an email from So <disfmarker> the the technology department . Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . They have done uh research about it , Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement . Yeah , if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can <gap> <disfmarker> Since you have to uh configure speech thing . But that's definitely more expensive Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . Yeah , we gotta de So uh <disfmarker> We have to decide on that . Yeah . Mm uh <disfmarker> Oh I got an email uh <disfmarker>
Well we can <disfmarker> I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um <disfmarker> This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out <disfmarker> both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so <disfmarker> Hmm . It's the most important part , I think . But <disfmarker> And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . Yeah , that's that's my findings . Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , but it's <disfmarker> Hmm . So <disfmarker> and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . <vocalsound> And I think <disfmarker> But it <disfmarker> That's on on the display . No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . So the focus is on these two parts . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we <disfmarker> I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .
It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to <gap> . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . Yeah okay . And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh <vocalsound> you don't see 'em very good . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . Okay . Yeah , But uh we we can switch those two , maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . So you don't see all the buttons you else need . <vocalsound> But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . Uh well um <disfmarker> So you can't use your thumb for it . This is how it is now . Um <disfmarker> But it's not not the best best . Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Yeah , Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . I've I've got something of that uh too . For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more . Scroll . By just putting the volume on the side . And and just channel buttons here . And the channels as well . But I think uh <disfmarker> or uh maybe uh <disfmarker> The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . it's <disfmarker> Basically it's it's here . Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . Yeah , that's better . They're on top ? Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . You mean uh these to the low ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button . Oh okay . Well , yeah . But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom . Mm <disfmarker> Maybe . I dunno ,
Okay . Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not <disfmarker> Nothing square-like . Okay , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . <vocalsound> Yeah . And it is well curved <gap> square . Square . Like . So not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look . Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means ,
<gap> Yeah . Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , one of the options . You can <disfmarker> Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . Okay . Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . <vocalsound> Five different <disfmarker> Yeah , uh <disfmarker> Or just uh sell different ones . Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . So you can still th look through it . looking , I think . Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the <vocalsound> remote control . Okay . Mm <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , So the colours also . it's <disfmarker> So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . Yeah . Black yellow control . <vocalsound> Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . Yeah , but uh <vocalsound> We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . <vocalsound> Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , it's cool . Yep . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue And still trans Oh yeah . So <disfmarker> Still still transparent . Okay . Yeah . But with all with logo on it . Okay .
But <disfmarker> No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So <disfmarker> Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah . Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . Yeah , Yeah . A more <disfmarker> It it could be like a Nokia , like <gap> plastic . <vocalsound> Uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah , just uh <disfmarker> With the hard hard buttons . That's better prob I think uh rubber really has an odd look . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the <vocalsound> uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . Yeah . Yeah , it's it's all on one level . it don't come out of the <vocalsound> on the background . Yeah , Yeah , that's cool . it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ? <vocalsound> I dunno what uh kind of material it is . But <disfmarker> But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Yeah . Just only the basic uh Oops . basic remote control from normal plastic , <vocalsound> and Yeah . the rounds of it from softer s Okay . And um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then the L_E_D_ . <vocalsound> I dunno . The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s . Y Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights or <disfmarker>
But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . So if you put <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh <disfmarker> Y i if you <disfmarker> The numbers could be can be <disfmarker> but they just said we need it . Okay . Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . Yeah , Yeah okay . Yeah We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? but <disfmarker> Oh no . Re recharger . Base station . Y Uh <disfmarker> Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . Yeah , batteries . Then uh I received some possibilities . <gap> Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh <disfmarker> Like with the pulse watch . So I don't think it will work , and <disfmarker> Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors , It's dark in the room . <gap> No . <vocalsound> It's just batteries , so <disfmarker> that's cheaper <gap> . Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Yeah . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth . Okay . So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons . Mm . So Yeah , I think . Yeah . Definitely . Um these kinda materials can be used . But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . Yeah . because you scroll too fast . And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . Mm <disfmarker> I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . that was it I guess . Okay . Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or <disfmarker> Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's <disfmarker> Uh I don't think a rubber case looks <disfmarker> Uh but we have to do something about the trend . i it it should be soft . You said so ? The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . Yeah , okay . And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . Uh yeah i Just <disfmarker> Just on front . yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control . No . I just can't imagine it . <vocalsound> So just hard plastic ? Yeah . Titanium . It's mentioned here uh . Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . more rounded . But just in two D_ , not in depth . Yeah . Okay . So <disfmarker> We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . <gap> So the energy uh is the recharger . We already know that . Yeah . Just a normal battery . We have batteries . Regular . Okay , the case is just a plastic one . Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular . I think I'll just check it . And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . <gap> Yes .
But th think about something that's more rounded . Just <disfmarker> And more <disfmarker> Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? Yeah , five . Let's give five . Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . Yeah . So we should did it here ? That's for the next one . So we're staying here ? Uh that <disfmarker> I think that's the next next meeting . Okay . But you definitely get a specific instruction . <vocalsound> Okay , Or more now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?
Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . Yeah . 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . And the LED . Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . So <disfmarker> You have to look at that image of the iPod . Yes . Okay . Where you can put a ve Uh we have <disfmarker> If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right . Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? Maybe you can buy separate ones And um uh <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . tha that will be <disfmarker> So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? Yeah , So you could put it like that , so top down . okay . Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . Do we have to design that w as well ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh I'm not sure . The docking station ? Yeah , I think so . Yeah , we can b But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least . It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . Yeah , we had one example . But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . Mm . Mm . So I think that can be all kind of shapes . But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . Of the remote control ? Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh <disfmarker> As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . Shapes . Okay . Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it <disfmarker> Uh it's very annoying . Okay . I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . <gap> I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . Uh <disfmarker> That is for elderly . So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . Yeah , I don't know . Yeah . I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . Yeah . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . Mm-hmm . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . <vocalsound> Yeah . And you have the scroll button inside . Yes . Just a simple scrollb <gap> Okay . Yeah . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of <disfmarker> Skip that one as well . Doesn't have to be . Okay . Yeah , it's cool . Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , So just <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Mm . It <disfmarker> The th th Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . No . So that's already a very big change Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the <vocalsound> wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . compared to <disfmarker> Yes . Just a <disfmarker> We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think <disfmarker> Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a S <vocalsound> Uh yeah , then it w <vocalsound> advanced chip . I don't know . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . And we we have to build in a microphone and <disfmarker> and I do I don't know anything about that . so <disfmarker> I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , No . Becau Yeah . Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , But <disfmarker> And we need a <disfmarker> Fine . Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . Yeah , we probably do . Oh yeah , But we don't have any f information about the cost . I <disfmarker> We started with information about the cost was now th I just I just received the <disfmarker> Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . Yeah . Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . Just in inexpensive or <disfmarker> This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . And how how does it work ? Is it <disfmarker> Doesn't say . Just <disfmarker> You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh <disfmarker> So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . It doesn't has to say anything . it <disfmarker> Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . But i it's a separate chip . I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . <vocalsound> Well it it would be would be a good feature feature . Yeah . It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . Like a very big scroll-wheel . <vocalsound> Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . Okay . Okay , so we <vocalsound> have this at the moment . I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . Yeah , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh <disfmarker> That's not scrollable too easy . Like this . Uh wh what is the middle part ? That's the numbers . Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . Numbers , okay . Yeah , I agree as well . Use the dz It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . Because you already have the volume here , Yeah , Yeah , okay . I think uh zapping is the highest priority . Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , or you don't want a different <disfmarker> Yeah , of course uh . Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so <disfmarker> It ma it doesn't make a big difference . I I think it's <disfmarker> But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . It's it's obvious , I think . Yeah , I think <disfmarker> So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . I dunno .
Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . Yeah . So we should did it here ? That's for the next one . So we're staying here ?
Yeah , I think so too . The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume . Yeah , But it's not not the best best . Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . I've I've got something of that uh too .
So that's already a very big change Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the <vocalsound> wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . compared to <disfmarker>
Yeah okay . Yeah We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? but <disfmarker> Oh no . Re recharger . Base station . Y Uh <disfmarker> Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . Yeah , batteries . Because we have to know it . <gap> So the energy uh is the recharger . We already know that . Yeah . Just a normal battery . We have batteries . that's cheaper <gap> . Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Yeah .
Um these kinda materials can be used . But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . Yeah . A more <disfmarker> It it could be like a Nokia , like <gap> plastic . <vocalsound> Uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah , just uh <disfmarker> With the hard hard buttons . That's better prob I just can't imagine it . <vocalsound> So just hard plastic ? Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ? Regular . Okay , the case is just a plastic one . Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .
I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . Mm <disfmarker>
Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . So <disfmarker> You have to look at that image of the iPod . Yes . Okay . So just <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Mm . Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . more rounded . But just in two D_ , not in depth . Yeah . So I think that can be all kind of shapes . But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . Of the remote control ?
Uh the logo was has to be on there . Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? Yeah , five . Let's give five . Or more
Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . Yeah , we probably do . Well Yeah . it it would be would be a good feature feature . Becau Yeah . Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , But <disfmarker> And we need a <disfmarker> Fine .
I would do it <disfmarker> Yeah . I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . <gap> I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . Uh <disfmarker> Yes . Just a <disfmarker> We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think <disfmarker> Well it it would be would be a good feature feature . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of <disfmarker> Becau Yeah . so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh <disfmarker> That's not scrollable too easy . Like this . Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , But <disfmarker> Uh wh what is the middle part ? That's the numbers . Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . Numbers , okay . Yeah , I agree as well . Use the dz It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . So <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> It's very uh difficult to to to do it . Intro Because you already have the volume here , So just <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Mm . So I think that can be all kind of shapes . or you don't want a different <disfmarker> Yeah , of course uh . Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so <disfmarker> But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . Of the remote control ? Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement . Yeah , It ma it doesn't make a big difference . I I think it's <disfmarker> But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . Oh . It's it's obvious , I think . it's <disfmarker> Basically it's it's here . Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . Yeah , that's better . They're on top ? Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . You mean uh these to the low ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well , yeah . But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom . Okay . Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .
and also parameter changing . Ah yeah parameter okay . <vocalsound> So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um Okay . or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and <vocalsound> basically this is most of the <disfmarker> almost everybody has this stuff . Okay and and voice command did you uh <disfmarker> Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button <disfmarker> a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , Okay . right . <vocalsound> So um the question well first of all what to control . So <vocalsound> most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> but other people want th also remotes for <vocalsound> controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff Mm-hmm . and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . Mm-hmm . there is one <disfmarker> that is one thing . The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have Okay . uh at the same time as <disfmarker> and general voice commands if you want yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . <vocalsound> One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . <vocalsound> Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . a set of buttons for <vocalsound> linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . Okay . Yeah ? What do you mean by linear access then ? Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . Ah . So the better now for special navigation ? Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? Okay . Yeah
Yeah . So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . Mm-hmm . Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the <disfmarker> Okay . functional requirements . Okay so <vocalsound> in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects Mm . and the subjects also filled a questionnaire Yeah . Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . Okay . Yeah . Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm <vocalsound> we have to have a remote control uh very um <vocalsound> out for that . <vocalsound> Uh the buttons have <disfmarker> are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . Okay . <vocalsound> Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh <vocalsound> ten per cents of but of the buttons in the <disfmarker> in the remote control . <vocalsound> so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? Yeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons <vocalsound> . Okay . So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to <vocalsound> to Yeah . Um and um lot of the time they <disfmarker> it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
Mm-hmm . And uh remote controls are bad for What is her other side ? R_S_I_ <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> If you also <gap> up on a computer in a strange position . Okay so you <disfmarker> we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . Ergonomic . So you know that um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> for the younger it's very important To have L_C_D_ and voice . to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . okay ? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more <vocalsound> more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . <vocalsound> Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look <disfmarker> seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm <vocalsound> we have to have a remote control uh very um <vocalsound> out for that . <vocalsound> Uh the buttons have <disfmarker> are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . Okay .
Yeah but in fact we <disfmarker> it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management Huh . I think that should be the same . Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision .
Yeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? <vocalsound> Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . Okay . Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared <disfmarker> um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we <disfmarker> But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button <disfmarker> Okay so this is quite easy . Yeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh There is not that much constraints . Standard button one . yeah <disfmarker> standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . <vocalsound> I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . <vocalsound>
So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , <vocalsound> as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the <disfmarker> on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point . so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that <disfmarker> But teletext is just one button . Yeah . So .
there is a <disfmarker> I mean you know there is are some <gap> with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . Yeah . yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to <disfmarker> No , a wheel is better . Yeah . I would say the wheel is better . Because of that <vocalsound> So yeah the key point here is simple . Maybe . <vocalsound> So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see really . Yeah . Maybe switch T_V_ on and off <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh Yeah , <vocalsound> and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . Yeah . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . Just increase the cost . Okay . <vocalsound> The user does not have an advantage really . I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , It's a memory , yeah . you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . Okay . So no L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm . Hmm . And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Okay . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I I talk about that , yeah ? How should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental . Yeah . That would be cool . But eight months is really long Yeah . Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . We go faster ? Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . Yeah .
Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . Yeah . Okay . So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , No , a wheel is better . Yeah . I would say the wheel is better . Because of that <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . Yeah . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . Just increase the cost . Okay . <vocalsound> The user does not have an advantage really . So no L_C_D_ ?
Mm-hmm . Hmm . And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Okay . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . That would be cool . But eight months is really long Yeah .
Yeah . Yeah . but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um I dunno if you can open the <disfmarker> I dunno if I can open it . Here . Here . <vocalsound> Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? And <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> We have a technical problem uh . Do we think w s in the <disfmarker> in the wrong folder maybe ? <gap> mm . But it's not <disfmarker> Um . Maybe you can send it to me by email . Just to participant one . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that . I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . I'll go and check . Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? Okay . With the the whiteboard ? Yeah .
Yeah . So . Matthew is uh late again . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Probably an important man . Um . So well it is important for him to be here uh . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah we will <disfmarker> yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the <gap> here . Yes . Yes . Yes . Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . Mm . Um yes when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so Yeah . just for record I I will take uh notes again . Okay . And um well <vocalsound> first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 'Kay . when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no <vocalsound> uh no negotiation uh <vocalsound> possible in this matter . Yep . Um so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . Well we can't <disfmarker> no <disfmarker> we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . Okay Matthew . Nice uh you are here . Great .
Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . Yep . So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , Mm-hmm . and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , <vocalsound> Or browse . And also it's not too far from um a mobile . Mm . Mm-hmm . So people are used to that kind of shape , Mm . Mm-hmm . right . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . we don't take <disfmarker>
How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? Oh <gap> just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . Mm-hmm . The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . Yeah . it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only <disfmarker> It's a very basic minimal thing Mm . Mm . Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . Yeah . yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , L_E_D_ . the on-off button , in red . Mm-hmm . Here would be the volume . On the on the left , Oh yeah . maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . Also <vocalsound> so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , Mm-hmm . Yeah . uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .
<vocalsound> uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . <vocalsound> I just look how it feels all . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . Mm . Uh so well mm-hmm . then the this is the <vocalsound> a more a little uh smooth <gap> and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . Right . Mm . And so they have more space actually Mm-hmm . and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have
Mm-hmm . Yeah . you know . And the then we can al Yeah . Or is it just one <disfmarker> Yeah , put it back . Yeah . And do you think <vocalsound> it's <gap> . Yep <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Jo's making faces at me . <vocalsound> Yeah . So . then we settle on four . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I will gi 'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . Mm mm mm mm mm . The b that's the that that one ? Yeah . <gap> battery there . and then it'll still be in fashion . Yeah . we will just we just have to continue . Um so Yeah . just for record I I will take uh notes again . 'Cause sometimes Yes . So so so that that would make the trends equal , Yeah . so we we we really have <disfmarker> don't have , so it won't be really you know protruding or something . you can push push it again , you can push it . Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? Yeah . 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . so you can go up and down the channels , Mm-hmm . Yeah . uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Yes . The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <gap> given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . Yeah . Uh sample speaker , yeah . I would say two , three . Okay . Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So Yeah . So , Yeah . Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , Mm . Yeah . right ? <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . Yeah . So th th this would be double curves ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . Mm . Yeah . Yep . Okay . this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . Yeah . You're right <gap> . Yeah . So I'd be up for seven for innovation . Yeah . And the <disfmarker> And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is <disfmarker> Yeah . That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . um so this is a standard uh <gap> uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , Mm-hmm . and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo Play , pause . yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here Mm-hmm . and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it <disfmarker> From D_V_D_ player to television or something . Yeah . I really can change it , Okay . Yeah . So the cost for these were <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah . Mm-hmm . and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , This is the orange button , the <vocalsound> microphone . or in the button th here , Mm-hmm . uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . An yeah . And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , Mm-hmm . which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier Yeah . okay . And uh well Mm-hmm <vocalsound> . then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , Yeah . <vocalsound> when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , Bu Yeah . okay . <vocalsound> Design enter <vocalsound> . but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . It's basically to do that . Yeah . But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature <vocalsound> which shouldn't be shouldn't be <disfmarker> Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , <vocalsound> when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , Oh actually <disfmarker> well . Mm . you know , uh you want to uh <disfmarker> and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection Mm . He is used to it act Yeah . Mm . Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . Mm . And you have very good chances <disfmarker> It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So the the cost is actually a bit more , Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . It's evident . Yeah . Mm . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item <disfmarker> Yeah . Three Euros . and we still on fifteen , Yeah . A man <disfmarker> w w so <disfmarker> Mm . Well it's not so easy , like this one the normal . Yeah . Yes one . Yeah . When you look at this w , this u uh item , <disfmarker> Well uh if you <disfmarker> we can have <disfmarker> if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to Yes . Ca l we are just <disfmarker> I think th th yeah we should <vocalsound> stick with uh a number of keys Mm . because if we add too much then Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything . Mm-hmm <gap> . Yeah , grandmothers , yeah . Yeah . so <gap> Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . you can keep it aside . Yeah . I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape . Yeah . Well well <disfmarker> Mm . Mm-hmm . exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , Yeah that's true . Yeah . Yeah . but <disfmarker> If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being <disfmarker> applying to the the demographic Yeah . yeah . But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . Yeah . Mm-hmm . or <disfmarker> and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is <disfmarker> that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . Mm . Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . Yeah . But w we've got a set price . And people can still decide to use the cheaper one Yeah . instead of a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . Mm , yeah , indeed . Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . Yeah . We can <disfmarker> <gap> well we have to make a decision now , that's it . Yeah . Yes . which is really an appeal on the on the on the Yeah . on the <gap> and on the <disfmarker> Yeah . And if you want to target <disfmarker> W I I I just <disfmarker> So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . Yeah . Mm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , Yeah . yes . Because it <disfmarker> I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . Yeah . Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes <vocalsound> , So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons <vocalsound> . Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include Yeah . Yep . 'Kay . are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . Yeah . Yes . The field test will tell you how good . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . forget that one and look at that one now . Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one Yeah . and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , So . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . So Here there may <disfmarker>
So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh <vocalsound> it's it's sixteen Francs . It <disfmarker> Sixteen Euros . Sixteen Euros sorry . <vocalsound> So it's well outside the budget then . Then it's out of budget . But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . But w And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item <disfmarker> Yeah . Three Euros . so sorry . And um <disfmarker> That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? No no no , part of that , yeah . Part of that <gap> . So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . Yeah , yeah . Yes . Sixteen . Sixteen Euros . Okay . So .
Well well <disfmarker> Mm . Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . Okay . <vocalsound> if if we al already <gap> . So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . Mm-hmm . Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> These are the things we identified as being important . Um <gap> the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components Mm-hmm . um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . Okay so look and feel , innovation <disfmarker> <gap> And now it <gap> easy to use . Easy to use . And trends . Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ? Um well w w we can still discuss that . Okay . So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? No okay , No . this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , <vocalsound> so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . Mm-hmm . Okay . So it's the pink . Th th this is the first design . And the other one's green . yeah . Get that one . Um w <vocalsound> one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best . Okay . So . Look and feel . Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , yeah . so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But that's just half , we should also consider look , Mm-hmm . and then i it looks quite conventional . Mm . Don't you agree ? Mm yeah . On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five so <disfmarker> Well I will give it maybe <disfmarker> we have anyways <disfmarker> the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . It <disfmarker> though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case Yeah . Four maybe . Okay . So then then <disfmarker> And the other one ? Wow . <vocalsound> Ah . I think it's slightly better , um , Mm . No Mm . actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , Okay . It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve <disfmarker> Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . you can push push it again , you can push it . Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? Yeah . 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe it won't work so well . No you <disfmarker> it it not protruding actually , Well r r I'd say two or three for that one , personally . Mm . I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . So so <vocalsound> I would also say this is four . Okay . My <disfmarker> just that um the feel is that um you <disfmarker> right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm , okay . So I will say two . Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . Yeah , yeah . Innovation . The first one , not really muc Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , Mm . Yeah . right ? No but except for the design of the surf <vocalsound> . Do we <disfmarker> What <disfmarker> What features are we actually including ? You should be rea <vocalsound> Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? <vocalsound> Uh no I think it's more of the feel . There's nothing like that ? But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . Yeah . You're right <gap> . Yeah . So I'd be up for seven for innovation . Yeah . And the <disfmarker> And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . Yep . Mm . And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . Yeah , it gives it <disfmarker> Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is <disfmarker> Yeah . That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . Mm . Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . Okay . Is this <disfmarker> 'cause this is the <disfmarker> Th th there were different options we discussed then , we ha we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget . Okay . Sixteen Euros . Okay . So . Innovation for this one is two ? One ? It's a two , I would say two <gap> . the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , Bu Yeah , one , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> then it's I think one . Okay . <gap> Ease of use ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , Mm . They are used to it actually . Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . Yeah . Here there may <disfmarker> Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi Okay . Hmm . So maybe a three or a four . Uh yeah , One me um we hope <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . Mm . because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah it's a <disfmarker> actually the user has to put some effort to do <disfmarker> use that actually , No . but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . Is quite easy yeah . So so I think th three is good . Yeah . Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic . Mm . So So <disfmarker> we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? Twe twenty to forty , yes that's <disfmarker> no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . No . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So sh completely changed our demographic there , And <disfmarker> it's not part of the the funky young thing . Well exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , Yeah that's true . Yeah . but <disfmarker> If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being <disfmarker> applying to the the demographic Yeah . yeah . That's <disfmarker> it's still <disfmarker> Ye Mm w w w we <disfmarker> after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , Mm . that's right . But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . Yeah . I think <disfmarker> Yeah because it's so important <disfmarker> it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its <disfmarker> it targets , the right range of people , right ? Yeah . Uh yeah Mm . but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . Yeah . yeah <vocalsound> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . Mm , yeah , indeed . Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . <gap> Yeah . Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . Yeah . and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? And the demographics of <disfmarker> It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen Yeah And if you want to target <disfmarker> yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . yes . Because it <disfmarker> I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . Yeah . so . Wh what <disfmarker> what <disfmarker> I'd probably go with three again for that one . Yeah I think it's uh <disfmarker> it has more market actually . Or even <disfmarker> Even one and two . Or two . Mm-hmm . Two ? Yeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add <vocalsound> lot of sophistication on that . Mm-hmm . Yep . for the people to <disfmarker> And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy . Okay . Okay , the final point , trends . And following the trends . The trends . So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> So as it is , not really doing either of them . I think <disfmarker> Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some <disfmarker> have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and <disfmarker> not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons Uh okay . and so you can <disfmarker> that feels kinda spongy . But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . So it's sort of , yeah . Mm . the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . But that's if you're using the covers . And the then we can al yes . We can <disfmarker> we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? I mean <disfmarker> Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh <disfmarker> So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . Yeah . This is possible . I th I th I think <gap> <disfmarker> Uh uh y are you sure ? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . O o or just two things which can be put on each other . Maybe we can <vocalsound> but we have to decide it , we can put the the <vocalsound> the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers Mm-hmm . and s now try to invest in the in in the features . I think the <disfmarker> if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion Mm . even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah . 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , Mm . and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . Mm . Mm . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . Yes . yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . I mean <disfmarker> Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . Yeah , <gap> Yeah , it's one . Say , say one and two . One and two . <vocalsound> Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five <disfmarker> mm nine by five , one point s eight ? Just add it . <gap> One point eight yeah . This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two Four point <disfmarker> Uh four point two . yep . Very good . Okay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . Mm-hmm .
Both in i i Wow . or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to <vocalsound> we have to make it more attractive Yep . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and w when we <gap> to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . <vocalsound> Yes , well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That'll basically take us down to the budget . But I'm <vocalsound> and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . Mm . Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , Yeah . Yep . Mm , so maybe we have to recap with this one . tha Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So <vocalsound> let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , Mm-hmm . uh what kind of energy source uh I I <disfmarker> we didn't speak about that . It's a <disfmarker> it's a normal battery , or <disfmarker> Yeah , it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just <disfmarker> maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . What do you say , Mael ? Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . Electronics . <gap> given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . Yeah . Uh sample speaker , yeah . Yeah , yes , <vocalsound> I see <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I It's uh <disfmarker> Double curve . Mm . which one are we talking to ? Are you talking about this or that ? Well <disfmarker> yes , we are talking about , Mm-hmm . but they have the same shape , but , actually bu 'Kay . Uh , plastic would be the material . Yeah . The basic one , yep . Is it zero Franc ? <vocalsound> A special colour ? <vocalsound> Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . Uh <disfmarker> So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . Push . L_C_D_ is <gap> . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ <gap> . Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? th now this is per per unit , this number of components . So it would need twelve buttons . Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? No but for this one it's twelve Euro . No , for that one also . Yes . Twelve I believe . So this comes to eighteen . Mm . And that's without any special button supplements . Yeah , So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons . I think <disfmarker> but th do you agree th that thi Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Yes I But I thought it would be curved on two <disfmarker> it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . Well That makes uh seventeen . And what are just <disfmarker> The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah . <vocalsound> We have more , we've got those <disfmarker> the scroll wheel on the side So Mm . but it is not in the list . We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . Mm . Mm-hmm . yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker <disfmarker> That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . So <disfmarker> um <disfmarker> But still , yeah it <gap> We just need that actually . We need one . We're <disfmarker> We <disfmarker> We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ? w when we w a But the um <disfmarker> this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . Yeah but if you have the <disfmarker> near the L_C_D_ you can um <vocalsound> choose <disfmarker> select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . Transti I think it's going to be <disfmarker> y y I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . Say <gap> say it's regular , regular chip , Yeah . Okay . Okay . and we still on fifteen , Yeah . so <disfmarker> So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my Matthew ? Yes but that <disfmarker> maybe <disfmarker> Ca l we are just <disfmarker> But <vocalsound> <disfmarker> when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . So is it possible ? <vocalsound> But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . That'll be <disfmarker> So <gap> the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . Mm-hmm . And uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_ Uh <disfmarker> other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . Mm-hmm . the chip's up there already . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . <vocalsound> A So wha what what each of us think about the <disfmarker> because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um <disfmarker> Do you think it's important ? Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking . A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , Mm <disfmarker> Mm . Yep . for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or <disfmarker> and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is <disfmarker> that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . Mm . Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . Okay so we can get rid of it Yeah , it's true yeah . and then add a couple of buttons . But uh , do we want that ? For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . I <gap> think we have to come to a decision now , Okay . One man one vote . <vocalsound> S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yes . So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? You've <disfmarker> you you agree . W I I I just <disfmarker> So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . Yeah . th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . Mm . Mm . So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . No , is speech rec out now ? We've <disfmarker> The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . Yep . w we now we can just uh <disfmarker> So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings .
Mm . okay . Okay . Well My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . that's that's <disfmarker> So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . Yeah . Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one Yeah . and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price ,
good . Then we <gap> the same . Thank you . Okay . That was it . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . That's it . <vocalsound> Thanks . Cool .
Mm . <vocalsound> I see <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I It's uh <disfmarker> Double curve .
it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just <disfmarker> maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . What do you say , Mael ?
'Kay . Uh , plastic would be the material . Yeah . The basic one , yep .
Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . Electronics . <gap> given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . Yeah . I think it's going to be <disfmarker> y y I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah .
Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . Okay so we can get rid of it Yeah , it's true yeah . is speech rec out now ? We've <disfmarker> The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . Yep .
Mm . Yep . for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or <disfmarker> and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is <disfmarker> that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . Okay so we can get rid of it Yeah , it's true yeah . and then add a couple of buttons . But uh , do we want that ?
Mm . Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one Yeah . and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price ,
Yep . So Okay . w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . Okay ,
Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . Mm . Um yes Yes . Yes .
or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to <vocalsound> we have to make it more attractive Yep . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and w when we <gap> to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . Well
Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . Okay so we can get rid of it Yeah , it's true yeah . For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . I <gap> think we have to come to a decision now , w when we w a But the um <disfmarker> this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . Yeah You've <disfmarker> you you agree . W I I I just <disfmarker> So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . Yeah . Say <gap> say it's regular , regular chip , Yeah . Okay . Okay . and we still on fifteen , Yeah . so <disfmarker> So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my Matthew ? Yes but that <disfmarker> maybe <disfmarker> Mm . So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . No , is speech rec out now ? Ca l we are just <disfmarker> But <vocalsound> <disfmarker> when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . So is it possible ? <vocalsound> But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .

Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ?
Yeah . <vocalsound> Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . In our <vocalsound> uh in our findings we have seen that <disfmarker> when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So that indicates our technological advancement . Mm-hmm . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , Mm-hmm . it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh <disfmarker> and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls .
Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , <gap> and everything with fruits and vegetables , <gap> Well , that's good . you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Okay . Okay . and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh <disfmarker> our recent fashion update shows that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sorry . And people uh
Uh , yeah <gap> . Okay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people <disfmarker> um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . Uh okay . Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control <disfmarker> There is some inconsistency already in <disfmarker> ec existing in <disfmarker> between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . Right , okay . Yeah . And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . <vocalsound> I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . Right , okay . This one is <disfmarker> got a kind of scroll like a mouse , Mm-hmm , like the middle button . Yeah . Okay . Um and <disfmarker> But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , <vocalsound> is it ? Right , okay . But the one below that has got like <vocalsound> a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . Yeah , presumably . I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It looks like Hmm . Um this one I thought was really cool . yeah <gap> . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . You can put it in there , <vocalsound> it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . I think something like that would be good . Wow . Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <vocalsound> , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . Of course yellow . <vocalsound> Right , yeah . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . And um this one <vocalsound> is just pointing out . I like <vocalsound> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but <gap> pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um I like I like the colourful buttons as well . Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um .
Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . Mm-hmm . I think that's a good idea to go for . I like I like the colourful buttons as well . Yeah . So we need to combine those ones um <vocalsound> and I've just got <vocalsound> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Brilliant . Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so <vocalsound> I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's <disfmarker> you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , Okay . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh , I think . And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ? But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . Uh-huh . But our budget , we've <disfmarker> Uh yeah . It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . Yeah . Okay . I'm not sure if the <disfmarker> if <vocalsound> for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , <gap> . Okay . Yeah . I can't see tha 'Kay . Looks pretty complicated . There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could <disfmarker> I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . Right , okay . Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got <disfmarker> I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , <gap> That's true , yeah . It just seems kind of like a a needless th And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . Right . It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of <disfmarker> we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , I know , carrot <vocalsound> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um the child-friendly , yeah .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , Yeah , looks like it . and I'll I'll give you the uh , <vocalsound> I guess , technical considerations for those . Mm . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <gap> And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it <vocalsound> . Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this <vocalsound> is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , <vocalsound> and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <vocalsound> and keep it all within budget . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . <vocalsound> Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , Mm-hmm . um <vocalsound> and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , So this is what we need to have for certain . <vocalsound> Okay . Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . <vocalsound>
'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . <vocalsound> Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , Mm-hmm . um <vocalsound> and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
Other parts or uh <disfmarker> Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours Mm-hmm . Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . Organic sponge . <vocalsound> Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and Yeah . Um . and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Yeah so <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic <disfmarker> initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex <disfmarker> I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and <disfmarker>
Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . Yeah . So multi-coloured buttons . You do have ones like um play <vocalsound> could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . <gap> Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . <vocalsound> Makes it easy to use . Yeah . <vocalsound> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel <disfmarker> I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , Okay . Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go <disfmarker> Um how exactly ? Maybe double <disfmarker> Like uh <vocalsound> an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , so we need a microphone presumably . Okay uh I could put the microphone here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or <disfmarker> I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's <disfmarker> button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . You can standardise those ,
Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , No . I mean uh <vocalsound> some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . Mm . Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . Uh-huh . There's a good man . There's a good idea . Okay . we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . Mm-hmm . With the scroll-wheel or no ? Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Uh speech recognition , I think , <vocalsound> We could make novelty remote controls . Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , Well , yeah , Yeah , yeah . right ? Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . How would you point it ? Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . What <disfmarker> We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . <vocalsound> Yeah , I appreciate this idea , <gap> y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . Huh ? does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , okay . I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? And sponginess . And spongy , yeah . So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Spongy . So it'd look like this kinda . Yeah , that's what I was thinking . Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? Uh . I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ?
But w <vocalsound> like just normal light ? I think we should <disfmarker> a rechargeable <vocalsound> battery will be a good idea . Oh that's true . is having a , yeah , having a rechargeable stand , Yeah . so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as <disfmarker> uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . Yeah .
Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . Okay . Okay , um now what we have <disfmarker> uh our next meeting's in half an hour 'Kay . and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . Oh ,
uh our next meeting's in half an hour 'Kay . and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . Oh ,
Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , Yeah . so <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic <disfmarker> initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex <disfmarker> I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and <disfmarker>
Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . Uh-huh . There's a good man . There's a good idea . Okay .
So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different Yeah . Um I mean e even if <disfmarker> I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . Yeah . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . Yeah . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a <disfmarker> too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , Mm 'kay . because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay .
With the scroll-wheel or no ? Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . uh , I think . And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ?
But w <vocalsound> like just normal light ? I think we should <disfmarker> a rechargeable <vocalsound> battery will be a good idea . Oh that's true . is having a , yeah , having a rechargeable stand , Yeah . so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as <disfmarker> uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . Yeah .
So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , No . Yeah . I mean uh <vocalsound> some uh I Um I mean e even if <disfmarker> l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . Mm . I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . Yeah . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . Yeah . Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . <vocalsound> Makes it easy to use . Yeah . <vocalsound> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel <disfmarker> Mm 'kay . <gap> y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . Huh ? does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , okay . I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? <vocalsound> Yeah . And sponginess . And spongy , yeah . So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Spongy . Well , um because <disfmarker> Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit So it'd look like this kinda . Yeah , that's what I was thinking . Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? Uh . I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a <disfmarker> too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . Okay . Okay .
Where we uh <disfmarker> We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . Okay . We uh are to get acquainted . So does everyone want to say who they are ? <gap> that seem sensible ? Yeah . I'm Robin . I'm the Marketing Manager . I'm Louisa . I'm the User Interface Designer . I'm Nick . I am the Industrial Designer . And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . <vocalsound> Alright okay ,
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh . Right , so agenda of the first meeting . Where we uh <disfmarker> We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright okay , so tool training . Um . <vocalsound> Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ? Tool training I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . Neither am I <gap> . <vocalsound> Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to um <vocalsound> basically to come up with a new r remote control device . <gap> Uh we have uh <disfmarker> the starting base was the original <vocalsound> which has been in existence now for a period of time . And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to <vocalsound> to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . <vocalsound> Yeah . So um <vocalsound> method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh <vocalsound> the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So um <vocalsound> in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device . Yes . And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . Um
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . Right . Hello . Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . 'cause to be honest with you uh <gap> I'm not too keen on them anyway . Not to worry . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . Mm-hmm , okay . So we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh . <vocalsound> So we will um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . Okay <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever . I don't mind . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . Little smiley cat there . <vocalsound>
uh if we're still all with us . Right okay , so . Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . Mm-hmm . That information has come from our marketing manager here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . And therefore making a profit margin of uh <disfmarker> well not actually a profit margin it's uh <disfmarker> because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . <gap>
<gap> So um <disfmarker> Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote . So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . Yes . <gap> So uh any any thoughts ? Um I <gap> with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . As that is the main function . Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um <disfmarker> we're looking for a device that is um robust Yes . and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily . Um we're looking for a device that is uh <disfmarker> What was the other things you said there ? Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . Easy to use . Can I just check ? <vocalsound> Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . Mm-hmm . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . <gap> Mm . Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? Oh I w um <gap> basically I'll get back to you on that . <vocalsound> But it seems to me sensible , 'cause <disfmarker> as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . Yeah . And uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So a device for for all remotes . <gap> you go . You go . Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of <disfmarker> remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So <disfmarker> whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Comes to your whistle . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But is it <disfmarker> in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to <disfmarker> Yeah . 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Yeah . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . Mm-hmm . And so these are probably mutually exclusive options Yes . Mm-hmm . Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more <gap> with handling them , Yeah . therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , <gap> Better instructions . Yeah . I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . Mm-hmm . So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where <disfmarker> you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of <disfmarker> you can link it to that as well , maybe .
<vocalsound> Sorry about that . <vocalsound> Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . Marketing , the user requirement specification . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . So .
'Kay , yes . Mm-hmm . I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , Television remote control . so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . Right . That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change <vocalsound> where we're going . Okay cool . But at this point in time I think you're right that uh <disfmarker> shall we make it just a T_V_ . Okay ?
<vocalsound> Sorry about that . <vocalsound> Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design .
Marketing , the user requirement specification . Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design .
Marketing , the user requirement specification . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design .

But at this point in time I think you're right that uh <disfmarker> shall we make it just a T_V_ . Okay ?
F_ five . F_ five <gap> . I've lost my screen . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , so did I . I've got a touch-pad . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Mm . <vocalsound> You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Is <disfmarker> No . Never close your laptop . Yeah ? Everybody's ready ?
Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , Uh , so you all know . <vocalsound> Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Mm-hmm . Uh , some of the <vocalsound> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our Okay . goal is . Um , I <disfmarker> oh forget <disfmarker> I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Yeah . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions ,
Mm-hmm . Uh , some of the <vocalsound> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .
You can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , <vocalsound> Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . <vocalsound> piranha . Okay . and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . Yep . Okay . And uh <disfmarker> so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . Okay , <vocalsound> Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . <vocalsound> Yes . so I don't have to tell you about that . Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um <disfmarker> there's a document folder called um the sh <vocalsound> shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Okay , Okay . Okay . This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we <disfmarker> well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> I wouldn't call it training , but <disfmarker> Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . <gap> <disfmarker>
Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? Hmm . I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . Yeah , okay . Okay . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh <disfmarker> And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Okay . And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um <disfmarker> what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . <vocalsound> For the bear . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh <disfmarker> I I uh , no I think it <disfmarker> It's international , so we have to use a standard . Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh <disfmarker> Well , m has to be something <vocalsound> spectacular or uh one which makes it <disfmarker> Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when <disfmarker> well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls .
Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . Oh , it is only for televis <gap> I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . Yes , it is only for television , but uh <disfmarker> Yes , that's uh something extras . Okay . And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um <disfmarker> what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . Yeah . Yeah , television remote control .
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d Yeah . <vocalsound> the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . He is the whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , close it . I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , okay . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down Alright . Great . Oh . We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh <disfmarker> Already s said that . The User Interface Designer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> is it a User Inter User Interface <disfmarker>
Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh <disfmarker>
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d Yeah . <vocalsound> the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi we will uh <disfmarker> Already s said that . The User Interface Designer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> is it a User Inter User Interface <disfmarker>
Yeah . <vocalsound> the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us .
Yeah , okay . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down Alright . He is the whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , close it . I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <vocalsound> Okay .
Mm-hmm . Uh , some of the <vocalsound> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .
<vocalsound> I wouldn't call it training , but <disfmarker> Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros .
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . <gap> <disfmarker> The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide ,

F_ five . F_ five <gap> . I've lost my screen . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , so did I . I've got a touch-pad . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Mm . <vocalsound> You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Is <disfmarker> No . Never close your laptop . Yeah ? Everybody's ready ?
Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . Oh , it is only for televis <gap> I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . Yes , it is only for television , but uh <disfmarker> Yes , that's uh something extras . Okay . And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um <disfmarker> what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . Yeah . Yeah , television remote control .
So I guess that that <vocalsound> we're totally <disfmarker> we're making a remote control which is thrilling I dunno if you guys had time to check the <disfmarker> in real life I dunno if you guys uh <vocalsound> checked the um <vocalsound> uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <vocalsound> tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up .
So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm Marty , um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . Um yeah . So <disfmarker> I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . Marketing , That's me . I'm Ron . I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer . I'm Nathan , I'm from California ,
we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So <vocalsound> um Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . uh project finance . <vocalsound> Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . <vocalsound> This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_
uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um <vocalsound> and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um <vocalsound> U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from <disfmarker> in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> what the user's gonna want . What they're looking for .
Simple . Yeah . But <disfmarker> I'm thinking <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design Specific . so touch screen design rather than button Okay . Oh right . so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . That'd be different . Hmm . Eur internationally . So <vocalsound> um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Okay . but that's a little bit annoying . Right . True . Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um <vocalsound> uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes <vocalsound> , of um <vocalsound> so you <disfmarker> like <disfmarker> maybe like an L_ <disfmarker> like a touch screen type of remote ? Mm-hmm . Possibly . Um any questions , before we get started ? I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products . <vocalsound> You mean to like <disfmarker> For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . Mm . Sounds interesting . no it's <disfmarker> they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , Yeah . I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . good idea , good idea . We'll see what <disfmarker> see what <disfmarker> Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . <vocalsound> Nice . Hot . <vocalsound> let's do it , let's do . S does anybody have any initial ideas ? I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door Yeah . I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . Um .
so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um <vocalsound> project documents ,
uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um <vocalsound> and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um <vocalsound> U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there
and you'll also get s assignments from <disfmarker> in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> what the user's gonna want . What they're looking for .

Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . <vocalsound> Nice . Hot . <vocalsound> Eur internationally . So <vocalsound> um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Okay . Um any questions , before we get started ? I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products . <vocalsound> You mean to like <disfmarker> For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . Mm . Sounds interesting . good idea , good idea . We'll see what <disfmarker> see what <disfmarker>
Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls Yeah , thank you . Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , <vocalsound> Jesus . Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available <disfmarker> Then <disfmarker> <gap> And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Okay . Speech recognition . Uh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . <vocalsound> So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , Hmm .
Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .

more kind of hand-held more um <vocalsound> not as uh computery and so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . Sales , <gap> . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark Mm-hmm . um which <vocalsound> does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . Yeah . Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , Okay . or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . Yeah . Okay ? Mm-hmm . and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? Um , or if <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is that a function we want in the remote ? Um , I haven't been able to <disfmarker> Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> That's costly though . Yeah . Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also <disfmarker> I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , <vocalsound> Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , Mm-hmm . Yeah . Sounds good . uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? Yeah , something . That can come under Arlo as well . And the findings , well the basic <disfmarker> that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . That's what people want to do . Uh . Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them , I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . <vocalsound> Uh okay . These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . You know they're grey , 'Kay . they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , <gap> <vocalsound> and they don't look very exciting at all . Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Personal preferences . Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um <gap> And um I thought not too edgy and like a box ,
So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? <vocalsound> Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . <vocalsound> Okay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . Mm-hmm . An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <vocalsound> Okay . um , we don't wanna have it <disfmarker> Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? Uh . Or a little base station or something , <gap> . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . the unirs the user interface <vocalsound> Okay . uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power <vocalsound> behind our product . <vocalsound> Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it um so it's good you went first , <vocalsound> and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . Let's remember that . and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so <disfmarker> uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , <gap> there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . Mm-hmm . But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . Mm-hmm . Oh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . Mm . Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . <vocalsound> Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um <vocalsound> and not computery , <vocalsound> right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . <vocalsound> Right .
and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . Corporate colour . Yellow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . Mm-hmm . And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <disfmarker> I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor <vocalsound> Ooh that's tight . Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , Just push it . Yeah . We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Mm-hmm . Um , <vocalsound> dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , Okay .
Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 'Kay . we had as listed options we had <vocalsound> speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Mm-hmm . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the <disfmarker> a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . Yeah yeah . Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the so it sorta keeps it simple . Okay . Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? Um <disfmarker> and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . Mm-hmm . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , Mm-hmm . Oh it's <disfmarker> I don't , I've <disfmarker> I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . They're act there this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or <vocalsound> something Ah , that's a good idea . <gap> um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . Right . then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay , well we can use <disfmarker> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , Yeah , Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . Right . you know they get thrown around , Mm . there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um . <gap> Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she <disfmarker> they wi Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a Oh . Yeah you think so ? no ? Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . Oh right , okay . <vocalsound> Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? Yeah . Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . Glow in dark . Uh <disfmarker> if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . <vocalsound> Uh o okay . Yeah . <gap> And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , So <disfmarker> it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . Um , a bit more <vocalsound> durable and that can also be ergonomic Okay . Oh no , ethics , <vocalsound> that's gonna cost us money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . <vocalsound>
speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? Yeah . Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . Glow in dark . Uh <disfmarker> if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . <vocalsound> Uh o okay . Yeah . <gap> And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . so it sorta keeps it simple . Okay . Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? Um <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay , well we can use <disfmarker> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , Yeah , Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . Right . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um . <gap>
Mm-hmm , okay . Cool . And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the <disfmarker> what was it ? it's not working . Can't believe I've forgotten it <gap> . We put the fashion in electronics Oh yeah , that's a good one that .
Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um . <gap> Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? Yeah .
Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . Glow in dark . Uh <disfmarker> if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . <vocalsound> Uh o okay . Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . Right .
Gonna have to swap them round so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> now , it was function F_ eight . So , after that ? F_ eight . <vocalsound> f oh sorry F_ eight . That's the wee blue one . Function F_ eight , okay . Hold on , sorry . <gap> and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . No signal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Computer . There you go . Computer adjusting , yeah . Okay . Cool . F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . Escape . Well , uh let me set this up . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ? Or function F_ eight ? Okay . Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . Okay . I think it's <vocalsound> uh just to lock it in . Then . Uh it was function I want to go to . Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . Uh , escape , okay
Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , Mm-hmm . standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um <vocalsound> and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um <vocalsound> and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ?
Um <vocalsound> and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation . Is that <gap> for us ? Yep . Okay . Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . Yeah , Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it Make sure the camera's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I can hold it like <disfmarker> and I'll I'll show you the presentation . Yeah , Right . Mm 'kay . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 'Kay . It's gonna have a a plastic body <vocalsound> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . You able to look <gap> ? Yep . <gap> This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing Mm-hmm . um which there'd be sort of a wide choice <disfmarker> they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Okay . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um <vocalsound> it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design <vocalsound> and uh <vocalsound> the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <vocalsound> how do you say , it's <disfmarker> yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top <vocalsound> <gap> . The black and white touch screen wherein people can <disfmarker> Mm . So it's flush . and the buttons at the bottom would d Right . so so it'll fully close flat . Oh right , okay , yeah . <vocalsound> And working on the inside <gap> <gap> we've um already said <disfmarker> d decided on the kinetic batteries , which <disfmarker> actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of <disfmarker> So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . okay . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <vocalsound> and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . <vocalsound> Or something . <vocalsound> tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's <disfmarker> be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Infrared <gap> . Um it would it would have <disfmarker> obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . <vocalsound> And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the <disfmarker> on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the <disfmarker> we haven't <disfmarker> Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing , So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . yes . Yeah . Yeah , that would make sense . And then finally um on to the interface . <vocalsound> The top screen , as we said , is <disfmarker> would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen <gap> which <disfmarker> yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , This one right here . uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . <gap> . Okay . And now we've <disfmarker> we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . Which is <disfmarker> But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . Look up to it . Okay . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is <disfmarker> that's the company logo <gap> . Thank you very much .
Well done . okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria . Certainly . Okay . Sorry . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . <vocalsound> So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those <disfmarker> the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . <vocalsound> we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Yeah . So we're going to look at these crite Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market <disfmarker> Yes , we're going to come to <disfmarker> w we'll discuss each one Mm-hmm . and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Okay . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? so you can <disfmarker> Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy <disfmarker> it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false . <vocalsound> I would agree . Mm yeah . Almost three . Two and three quarters ? I think yeah . Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . <vocalsound> Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . I'd give it a one . Okay . and we're just waiting for your rating two point f It's just two point five for that one . f yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . Two . Two . I would say a two . I would say a two . A two , okay . <vocalsound> We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . One point seven f five . Yeah . Um mm now we're looking at D_ . it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . Yeah . Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Yeah , Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? that's <disfmarker> No , no , the the base colour was um <vocalsound> white or or like or l sort of a light blue , White . With <disfmarker> for the plastic ? Uh blue . but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any <disfmarker> basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . Right . Any <disfmarker> So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Right . Yeah , because you'll be having a <disfmarker> Because of the rubber case . 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that <disfmarker> otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me . Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . Yep . Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . Mm . No . We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Yeah . Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ It's meant to be . with the size that we've got it's quite small , <gap> but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . Mm . It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um <disfmarker> Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , A five , okay . And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really <disfmarker> have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , Voice r recognition . yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . Yeah , yeah , that <disfmarker> yeah , that's feasible . That sounds good then . I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand A standard . it would be quite loud . It would be . So it would be s p You built into the feature . And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . yeah . Okay . Logical . That's a one for me . <vocalsound> Yeah , one . and one , good . <vocalsound> I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , <vocalsound> So , how do we feel about this ? We've got our our <disfmarker> we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . <gap> <gap> The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . <vocalsound> Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it ,
The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . <vocalsound> Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? I don't think so . W I thin yeah , We happy to go ahead ? I think <disfmarker> I think we <disfmarker> yeah . I think we're set . yeah . Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Do much apart from having a huge big <disfmarker> Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . <vocalsound> Okay ,
Yeah , shall I show ? Yeah . I'll show . and you can just take it off . Yeah . Ta-da . So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . yes . Yeah . Yeah , that would make sense . I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Two point five , okay . Yeah . Losing one decimal place , that's okay . because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . One point seven f five . Yeah . Okay , mm-hmm . now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . One . Yeah . Right . So We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Yeah . Well I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Yeah . Yeah , have we really <disfmarker> have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , I think we <disfmarker> yeah . I think we're set . yeah . Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , <vocalsound> Okay , Hmm . I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in that um <disfmarker> Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ? Yeah . Yes . Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right , what's happening with the electronics ? It was a regular chip on print Chip on print . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number One chip . Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . Okay . Y Single-curved . One double curve . Two , 'cause it's two . Two curves , yeah . But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . So what's a single curve then ? Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . <gap> like a domed thing . yeah , so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Um we've got plastic and rubber , a plastic . haven't we ? Yeah . Yeah . Plastic one <vocalsound> <gap> . No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , Um <disfmarker> we can put point five . Yeah . Do you think ? yeah . We can use that . Yeah . Okay . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . It would be like saying we're using <disfmarker> See , it says case material . Mm-hmm . So we're not actually using plastic in the case , No , no , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . <gap> So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . Okay . Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . Yeah , okay . No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ? Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . N Push-button . Yeah , the push-button's one One . and L_C_ display one . An One . Buttons <disfmarker> S <vocalsound> I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . Has that not made any d So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? Yeah . Uncurved , flat . I think it's in Euro <gap> . Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um <vocalsound> and the interface . If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? And going to a regular bat Yeah , the standard , Yeah . it <vocalsound> um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away <disfmarker> if you took away <disfmarker> What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery <gap> . If you to It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . Yeah . But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . Um <disfmarker> Right , okay . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's <disfmarker> that's minus three . They <vocalsound> n n it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . Yeah . Yeah . Sure . If we if we're working to head office specifications as <disfmarker> this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we <disfmarker> the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . Yes . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . because it also sets it apart from the crowd . They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . Yeah . It's <vocalsound> s something completely different associated with your company . Yeah . Right , okay , so <disfmarker> that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? Yeah . No . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Yeah . Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't <disfmarker> didn't feel able to make . Um Yeah . I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . Mm-hmm . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . um in the sense that I think we had a nice time . there was so much interaction , Yeah . so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually <disfmarker> if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , Yeah . Yeah . you know , Mm . I like that . Um Yeah . teamwork . How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? yeah . Yeah . Could it've been better , Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , Yeah . Yeah . yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . Yeah , <gap> moving around the room . Yeah . <vocalsound> But I think it's good , It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , rather than <disfmarker> Yeah . it so it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , Yeah . just jazz it up a bit . Mm . Uh d they don't really think about it , Yeah . because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , Yeah . Yeah . I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , No . <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , Yeah . you would pray <disfmarker> you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being <disfmarker> a plastic was being made for you . Yeah . But people could <gap> have anything that they wanted . Because of the produ Mm . Yeah . And new f television products coming up , There are innovations in that that people don't really want . Yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore Yeah . and it's innovation for innovation's sake , The the people have to keep buying . But forcing it onto people , Yeah . yeah . So it looks <disfmarker> well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . Yeah . Maybe fifty percent more . and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . Yeah . No . and it still makes such an innovative item Mm . Yeah . that I think people are really gonna want . Yeah . It's a shame it won't ever get made . <vocalsound> Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , the the s Yeah . yeah . I think <disfmarker> yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . Yeah . Mm .
But we're still working to um head o So should we just change the design specification then ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Make it costly . We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as <disfmarker> this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we <disfmarker> the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . Yes . but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers Okay , Yeah . Right , okay , so <disfmarker> So if we take voice recognition out <disfmarker> That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Yeah <gap> we are . we are close to the budget . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? Two five . So we are under the budget . Well done , people . they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . Um <disfmarker> Right , okay . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . Well we can do <disfmarker> it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . Yeah . You could choose to have that or not . But they <disfmarker> but I mean in <disfmarker> I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually <disfmarker> if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , Yeah . teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . <vocalsound> Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Yeah . Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't <disfmarker> didn't feel able to make . Um Yeah . I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . Mm-hmm . Or did you feel like <vocalsound> uh autonomy ? Yeah , I'd say , as a team . Although we had our separate tasks , I think we had a nice time . there was so much interaction , Yeah . so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . Find out from each other , yeah . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . Thank you . yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to
and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually <disfmarker> if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah .

Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . <vocalsound> Or did you feel like <vocalsound> uh autonomy ? Yeah , I'd say , as a team .

We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . Thank you . yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to
And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving uh much idea to this . I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , Like Sarah was telling , everything's <disfmarker> Right . because <vocalsound> just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . Yes . and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . Well ,
Yeah , <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they <disfmarker> the budget be increased , but I think <disfmarker> it was <disfmarker> I think we've done very well to get within budget what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well . I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . I think that was just the the physical . and it still makes such an innovative item
Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . There's a final questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <vocalsound> <vocalsound> everything that I fell behind with , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In your <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Make it costly . We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as <disfmarker> this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we <disfmarker> the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . Yes . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they <disfmarker> the budget be increased , but I think <disfmarker>
Mm-hmm . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . There's a final questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <vocalsound> <vocalsound> everything that I fell behind with , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In your <disfmarker>
have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , Voice r recognition . yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . Yeah , yeah , that <disfmarker> yeah , that's feasible . That sounds good then . and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . okay . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <vocalsound> and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . <vocalsound> Or something . <vocalsound>
But we're still working to um head o So should we just change the design specification then ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Make it costly . We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as <disfmarker> this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we <disfmarker> the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . Yes . but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers Okay , Yeah . Right , okay , so <disfmarker> So if we take voice recognition out <disfmarker> That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Yeah we can do <disfmarker> it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . Yeah . You could choose to have that or not . But they <disfmarker> but I mean in <disfmarker> I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 'Kay . It's gonna have a a plastic body <vocalsound> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . You able to look <gap> ? Yep . <gap> This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing Mm-hmm . um which there'd be sort of a wide choice <disfmarker> they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Okay . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it .
and uh <vocalsound> the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <vocalsound> how do you say , it's <disfmarker> yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top <vocalsound> <gap> . The black and white touch screen wherein people can <disfmarker> Yeah , that would make sense . And then finally um on to the interface . <vocalsound> The top screen , as we said , is <disfmarker> would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen <gap>
And now we've <disfmarker> we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . Which is <disfmarker>
We happy to go ahead ? I think <disfmarker> I think we <disfmarker> yeah . I think we're set . yeah . Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Do much apart from having a huge big <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they <disfmarker> the budget be increased , but I think <disfmarker> Yes . Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right ,
<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they <disfmarker> the budget be increased , but I think <disfmarker> Yes . Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right ,
Okay . Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . Yep . Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . <vocalsound> We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um <disfmarker> We're gonna have <disfmarker> discuss the functional design first , <vocalsound> how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright .
Alright , let's go forward then . Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . We could <disfmarker>
Guess we're getting straight back into business here . <gap> Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . Okay .
Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So . Anybody have anything to offer ? <vocalsound> Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ?
Okay . if po if we're gonna do it <disfmarker> It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . They're never universal . That's right . 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't <disfmarker> Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . They want like the flashy lights . Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> That's true . Um . What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually <disfmarker> D Double A_ . Double A_ . Okay . So double or triple ? Okay . Can you <gap> with a small lithium battery ? But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .
What do you think that means ? <vocalsound> which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design .
<vocalsound> Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , Mm-hmm .
I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .
Mm . Mm-hmm . But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? Yeah , a little bit . A little bit . and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . Okay . Mm-hmm . And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not <disfmarker> if if we could combine something with the push button . Okay . Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . Yeah . Yeah I I th <vocalsound> So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? But I don't think that uh we should <disfmarker> We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . Yeah . I haven't written my personal references . Um <vocalsound> the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , Okay . and if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . Mm-hmm . I have a question about that actually <vocalsound> . Um , what is the purpose of the light ? Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber <disfmarker> Is <disfmarker> You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? But <disfmarker> Yeah . Actually . But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to <disfmarker> when you move it to detect your movement . As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . Yeah , no it's too expensive . <vocalsound> I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , <vocalsound> First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light
and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? These are the basic thing . So it's only the central part . So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . Yeah . That's the major idea , as simple as possible . Yeah . Yeah . So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .
So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . Yeah . so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . Yeah <vocalsound> . So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . Yeah , if you have , for example <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . Okay . S some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . Mm-hmm . Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . Yeah .
Yeah . after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . <vocalsound> So , maybe if our <vocalsound> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <vocalsound> something like that , or <disfmarker> Okay . I support an apple . <vocalsound> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . <vocalsound>
This is good also for <disfmarker> Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . You can throw it to the television . Yeah , because it's robust . Okay <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe uh um <vocalsound> a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . What about um <disfmarker> The banana is also ergonomic . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . Or a fruit like that . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . <vocalsound> So , maybe if our <vocalsound> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <vocalsound> something like that , or <disfmarker> Okay . I support an apple . <vocalsound> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . Plastic . <vocalsound> Yep . So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher ,
If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . <vocalsound> we have to think about those aspects , sorry . So we will just use a a standard battery ? Yeah . chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ? I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . Oh <disfmarker> i i <vocalsound> Banana I think , it's a nice idea . Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . Because <disfmarker> but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , Yeah .
<vocalsound> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . Plastic . <vocalsound> Yep . So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , Yeah . And uh the chip we <disfmarker> chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?
chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ? I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . Banana I think , it's a nice idea . Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . Because <disfmarker> If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . <vocalsound> Yeah .
Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . Yeah . Yeah Has it ? that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . Yeah . but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , Yeah .
but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , Yeah .
sorry . So we will just use a a standard battery ? Yeah . we have to think about those aspects ,
But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , Yeah . Okay . No , that's <disfmarker> I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So Okay . <vocalsound> Um so <disfmarker> yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um <disfmarker> All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .
and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . I I didn't read i read it , it's not for me , You didn't read it ? I didn't get it uh anyway . No , It's only for you . I I was the only one who get it . Yeah . Yes . Okay it was uh uh uh um um <vocalsound> a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the <vocalsound> uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements . The last point is quite an interesting <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . Um Martijn alr already said it . if we <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but <disfmarker> I don't think it's uh Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , reachable . That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you <vocalsound> clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly . Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the <vocalsound> thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't <disfmarker> We we haven't <disfmarker> Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page . <vocalsound> Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . <vocalsound> But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , Yeah . Um then <disfmarker> I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's <vocalsound> not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise . Yeah , only only for television uh <disfmarker> Yeah , probably . On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . Yeah , so you can use it . Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . So it has to look uh uh uh unique , Unique . <vocalsound> The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . but <disfmarker> Yeah , I reckon <disfmarker> Yeah . But old people are not looking for that . Uh I think mm <disfmarker> I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . Yeah . I thought about it , yes . 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .
And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . <gap> So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , Yeah . because <disfmarker> because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . Yeah .
why not ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah . That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it <disfmarker> Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Oh , Who ? Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . They they're uh designed very well . Just <disfmarker> And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . Yeah . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . Yeah . But uh well , I think that's a good example . Okay . isn't it ? Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't <disfmarker> that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or <disfmarker> Yeah , I have it on the next page . But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Okay . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to <gap> . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable It's not , it's still not <disfmarker> It's not anymore n uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno , miss <disfmarker> Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? Um <disfmarker> Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need . Is <disfmarker> Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , I don't thi Forward . Li like a web browser , Six seven eight or five . so <disfmarker> Oh , okay . Just very simple . But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button . Um I dunno . I don't have <disfmarker> Uh I did <disfmarker> I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . <vocalsound> No . Uh <disfmarker> okay . Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? Normally you can press one , zero or <disfmarker> Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh <disfmarker> A ten plus or <disfmarker> Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . Okay . To just keep it simple and standard uh features . Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh <disfmarker> Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people <disfmarker> Uh yeah mayb It gets some seconds . But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um Oh okay . Yeah . it's it's no it's not a <disfmarker> So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . Yeah , It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . Okay . So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . Yeah . Uh I just thought of another one . Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . Yeah . So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh <disfmarker> But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , Yeah . so you have I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . four arrows . Because you n almost never use menu button . Yeah , okay , So <disfmarker> but um <disfmarker> Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to <disfmarker> Don't think so . I don't know where where you have to put it . <vocalsound> Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic <disfmarker> Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . Yeah . Does it have to be <disfmarker> Uh it has to be uh with different colours Um <disfmarker> I dunno . Different colours um <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow It's like a iMac or something . or <disfmarker>
Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to <gap> . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh <disfmarker> Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . Okay . But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your <disfmarker> Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ? No y Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , but not sure <gap> . So I'm , I u <disfmarker> I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? Well uh Well i If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call Never ? Okay now , m maybe not . If I don't do it , maybe old people <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , Yeah , I dunno . Right . They don't like new features . So maybe not .
I think we discussed everything . Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um <disfmarker> Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh <disfmarker> Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh <disfmarker> And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's er uh do two different things So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? but <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <disfmarker> I think it's usable . Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? Yeah , Two ? Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button . Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . Yeah , I know . I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . Yeah . Um that's connecting to all the components . <vocalsound> Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . Yeah . Yeah ,
Yeah . Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low . Yeah <disfmarker> To flash up your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , and <disfmarker> Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button . Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . Huh , that's a good idea . Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . Yeah , But one you can't see But it <disfmarker> But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED . Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is <disfmarker> Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . Yeah , okay . <gap> The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? Yeah , we're thinking about it . Why ain't that on a remote control ? It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . Yeah , It's f Yeah . Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . Mm-hmm . It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . Yeah . No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use <disfmarker> Yeah , I uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . Yeah . We'll have enough power So Maybe integrate it in the design as well . You have to <disfmarker> The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . <vocalsound> I I think uh the batteries will be uh <vocalsound> a little <disfmarker> Uh that's cool . <vocalsound> No , we have a recharger in it , Oh . And this one is producing normal light . Yeah , okay . Uh maybe . If we can still make that then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . but it doesn't have to be red . <vocalsound> It's just to indicate something's on .
Just to indicate it's working . So mm <disfmarker> And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the <disfmarker> Otherwise it won't work . So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh <disfmarker> No . I I uh <disfmarker> The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to <disfmarker> Okay . An automatically search function for each television , or something . Yeah . Yeah , or <disfmarker> I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there . Well , Uh I kno I I use a universal uh remote control , and <gap> list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , Yeah ? Oh , I have a modern one . <vocalsound> And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , <vocalsound> and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , So it uh <disfmarker> We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Yes . y you have this chip . Yeah . That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . Mm-hmm . But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . Yeah . Changing the signal . And um <disfmarker> What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so <disfmarker> And then he saves that setting Okay . Yeah .
So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . <vocalsound> Okay . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . Oh . Mm . Okay , that's <disfmarker> It changes things . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> That kinda changes the whole situation . Uh <disfmarker> Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . That still stays .
You only have a microphone in it . Yeah . I didn't have information about that . But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or <disfmarker> Nah , maybe <disfmarker> Ah that's a problem , but <disfmarker> And and uh w Yeah ? Uh only in English . Only in English I think . What <disfmarker> Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever but <disfmarker> Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do <vocalsound> do we do it ? Is <disfmarker> Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . It <disfmarker> We have short time to to put it on the market , Yeah , It's <disfmarker> In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages . Yeah . Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . And and <disfmarker> and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh <vocalsound> Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . the remote away . Yeah . Well yeah , that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , But <disfmarker> So you can see on the uh <disfmarker> Okay , no speech recognition . So That's important I think and <disfmarker> L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . Mm ah <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you <disfmarker> Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . <vocalsound> No , it's not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . No . What other features can we put in ? Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the <disfmarker> Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . But uh some of you had uh something to read about um <vocalsound> uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? That's very <disfmarker> That's fancy . That's cool . I didn't read <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah okay . Mm . Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . I I know . Mm . That should be cool . Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . If it's possible , I don't know . I didn't read it . I don't think it's very expensive actually . Mm .
Yeah , maybe you have you have to <disfmarker> Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . Yeah okay , but <disfmarker> Yeah , well With just uh standard buttons we just have so little <disfmarker> O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . No , I don't need don't need <disfmarker> Because you ne almost never use it . Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . Yeah , that's right . I use teletext as well . No , I use te teletext every day , I think . Hmm . Okay . Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Yeah yeah , one level . Okay . Mm . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , Also the one in the dark . So uh <disfmarker> It lights up when it's dark ? Yeah , but it's <disfmarker> Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . If you push something , it it all lights up . Okay . Yeah , but um <disfmarker> it it mustn't work all the time . Yes , that's what I mean . It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . So if you <disfmarker> No , Or maybe when you <disfmarker> if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . yeah . That's what I said . Okay yeah . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . D
How long is lunch break ? So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so <disfmarker> Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine .
How long is lunch break ? So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so <disfmarker> Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine .
So So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . And and <disfmarker> you can see on the uh <disfmarker> Okay , no speech recognition . So <vocalsound> Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . No .
Yeah , and <disfmarker> Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button . D But one you can't see Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , So And this one is producing normal light . That's what I said . Okay yeah . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . Yeah <disfmarker> To flash up your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one .
Yeah , maybe you have you have to <disfmarker> Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . Yeah okay , but <disfmarker> Yeah , well With just uh standard buttons we just have so little <disfmarker> O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . No , I don't need don't need <disfmarker> I use teletext as well . Yeah . Hmm . We definitely should use it . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , No , I use te teletext every day , I think . Hmm . Okay . Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Yeah yeah , one level .
Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . Yeah , that's right . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . <vocalsound> Okay . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . Oh . Mm . Okay , that's <disfmarker> It changes things . I'm sorry about that . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> That kinda changes the whole situation . Uh <disfmarker> Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,
that's <vocalsound> not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise . I have my personal uh preference . Okay ,
So mm <disfmarker> And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the <disfmarker> Otherwise it won't work . So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh <disfmarker> The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to <disfmarker> Okay . An automatically search function for each television , or something . Yeah . Yeah , or <disfmarker> I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there . Well , Uh I kno I I use a universal uh remote control , and <gap> list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , Yeah ? Oh , I have a modern one . <vocalsound> And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , <vocalsound> and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . Okay . So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . Yeah .
but if if you stick to um <disfmarker> stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , What ? No ? I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . Okay . so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? Yeah . No , I mean <disfmarker> Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that <disfmarker> It's not really the <disfmarker> we Y we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so <disfmarker> or something like that . But uh I think a user need <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um Mm . A nice one . attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . <vocalsound> I'm not sure the one in the middle <vocalsound> is very attractive . <vocalsound> We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , Mm-hmm . Mm . so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we <disfmarker> I think we can attract a lot of user . Okay . so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . or <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> then nn if he has something that works fine and is really <vocalsound> fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . no . Tha Not too expensive too . But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . See <vocalsound> <disfmarker> that's a function of T_V_ . Yeah .
I just have one question , Yeah . because for the intelligent controller , <vocalsound> you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , Yeah . but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? Y <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe . or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . Yeah , sure . For example , if you cannot find your uh <vocalsound> controller , you can just uh <vocalsound> just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . I One and <disfmarker> Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah but how how is <disfmarker> how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? Broken arm ? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? Yeah . Yeah , but the <disfmarker> so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , <vocalsound> Yeah but <vocalsound> Yeah we can <disfmarker> Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . yeah . Even you h you have the controller , I can <vocalsound> I can say channel three , No . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> it's <gap> <vocalsound> so it's c come to channel three , No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . I don't have to <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's advantage . Yeah . And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to Yeah , but one other question . manual controllers , eh . How how much will it cost ? No , more expensive maybe . How much ? No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . So I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . Well y y you have also the language problem , No when you <disfmarker> Mm-mm . 'Cause it it have to be universal , so . Yeah . I agree with uh <disfmarker> The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . Yeah . Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international <vocalsound> Yeah . Suppose we're <disfmarker> we want to sell it in France . Yeah . The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , the key , the key um the key of our <disfmarker> the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's <disfmarker> And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to <disfmarker> Oh really ? Yeah , but then w Seems to be quite complex . Yeah , I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just <disfmarker> the microphone is embedded in the controller . Yeah , A microphone maybe . Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . Okay you <disfmarker> so you can build a kind of black box Devic and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Yeah . But you would still have the buttons . Or is it <disfmarker> do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? think it <disfmarker> we should give the uh flexibility to the user Okay , yeah . Yeah , You can see <disfmarker> they can switch form one modality to another . Mm . Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky . Yeah . that's quite inter quite attractive . And maybe it will be quite <disfmarker> But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so <disfmarker> although y y If if <disfmarker> I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . More features , I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ? Yeah , but uh we want so but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . True . That's <disfmarker> the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our <disfmarker> from other products . Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . Yeah <disfmarker> Okay . So I mean , that's the point . let's go to the Industrial Designer . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , Okay .
Mm-hmm . Yeah , and i if you <disfmarker> we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . Mm-hmm . seems to be interesting , mm . And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . Yeah , we want something easy to use and <disfmarker> so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . Yeah . wood . And what about the buttons ? I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know <vocalsound> lighted buttons because , you know , it's <disfmarker> I don't know <vocalsound> um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess . <vocalsound> I think a touch screen <vocalsound> will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . so <disfmarker> It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r Okay . of the remote control . Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside Okay . So I <disfmarker> in fact the the <disfmarker> f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so Mm-hmm . will <disfmarker> it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and <vocalsound> in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , Mm-hmm . so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , Okay . And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation Uh-huh . or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come Mm-hmm . and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers Ecologists , Yeah . and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , <vocalsound> Alrigh In fact , having them both will <disfmarker> if we want to have battery , regular battery and and <vocalsound> the solar energy battery it could be <disfmarker> it'll it will add a little bit of the price , So . it depends for example you <disfmarker> if you have a wooden material it can be more <disfmarker> the plastic material is more common it's very resistant Impersonal , mm-hmm . but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , Yeah .
Uh no , trend watching . <vocalsound> The other one . <vocalsound> Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> i i it sounds good technically Mm . and uh <disfmarker> So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Okay . At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . <gap> Now i if we look at fashion in general um <disfmarker> Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , Ah yes . so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . Okay . we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , <vocalsound> Spongy <vocalsound> 'Kay . okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . Okay , yeah , yeah . I dunno . Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? Yeah thi this is this would be like um Pla plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh S
I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . Okay . Yep . <vocalsound> You will had s some more information in <disfmarker> Okay . I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . I s Okay . because i in my presentation I don't have here with <vocalsound> Okay , never mind . It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r Okay . <vocalsound> of the remote control . Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside Okay . and <disfmarker> so . or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . Okay . Okay . so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we <disfmarker> I think we can attract a lot of user . Okay . Okay . Something else ? And that will be compensated , Yeah . Okay . so hmm . Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , Okay . so . I dunno . <vocalsound> I think we have only <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh five minutes left . Okay . Participant four ? second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Okay . At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . Now i if we look at fashion in general um <disfmarker> Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . Okay . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . Okay . So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , <vocalsound> as you say you want something technologically innovative , Yeah . maybe using solar energy and <disfmarker> with battery would be something interesting , Solar . Yeah , so when I think it's <disfmarker> Okay . maybe will attract pro-ecology consumers . Yeah . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . Yeah , Later ? <vocalsound> So you think <gap> case . Something spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Someth no wood . <vocalsound> No wood but <disfmarker> Plastic ? Pla Maybe you <disfmarker> I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . Yeah , maybe the base . It depends on the design we want , so . Yeah , but where is the controller ? Okay . Where is the controller ? It's it's natural . But still y Th The feeling is natural , and i so maybe we can stay with wood . And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or Okay . I dunno . something that you can <vocalsound> into it . Yeah . Uh and what about the user interface concept ? <vocalsound> Google and <disfmarker> Google and fancy ? and fancy , f how about the the voice ? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . Yeah <disfmarker> d Okay . I dunno . So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . Yeah . It's good . And L_C_D_ buttons . Yeah , L_C_D_ . Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . Yeah , yeah , yeah . With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use Yeah , yeah . commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . Yeah . Mm . To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . Yeah , turning <vocalsound> <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . Simple ones ? Yeah , simple ones for <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> So If possible . Okay . And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . Okay . So , Okay . no more questions , Hmm . Sounds good , mm-hmm . Don't have a <disfmarker> the the <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah Okay . Yeah . Okay , cool . Okay . let's go to the Industrial Designer . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , Okay . Yeah . it's not this one . It's uh oth the oth <vocalsound> so I <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> so <vocalsound> we'll <disfmarker> you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Yeah .
Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <vocalsound> <vocalsound> expensive buttons <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , to make some new <disfmarker> and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yep . Yeah .
and uh the colour of the um the society will be really <disfmarker> it will be seen in the remote control . Need it to be , okay . So you will have <disfmarker> Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype Yeah . and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay .
I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .
Okay . I dunno . So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . Uh and what about the user interface concept ? <vocalsound> Google and <disfmarker> Google and fancy ? and fancy ,
maybe using solar energy and <disfmarker> with battery would be something interesting , Solar . So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . Yeah . as you say you want something technologically innovative , Yeah .
pro-ecology consumers . Yeah . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . Yeah , So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . Yeah .
Th The feeling is natural , and i so maybe we can stay with wood . And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . Yeah .
It's good . And L_C_D_ buttons . Yeah , L_C_D_ . Yeah .
I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . Okay . Yep . <vocalsound> You will had s some more information in <disfmarker> Okay . I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . I s Okay . because i in my presentation I don't have here with <vocalsound> Okay , never mind . It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r Okay . <vocalsound> of the remote control . Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside Okay . and <disfmarker> so . or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . Okay . Okay . so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we <disfmarker> I think we can attract a lot of user . Okay . Okay . Something else ? And that will be compensated , Yeah . Okay . so hmm . Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , Okay . so . I dunno . <vocalsound> I think we have only <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh five minutes left . Okay .

So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . Okay . So Yeah , so when I think it's <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , but where is the controller ? Okay . Where is the controller ? But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or Okay . I dunno . Yeah <disfmarker> d Okay . I dunno . Simple ones ? Yeah , simple ones for <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> So If possible . Okay .

I just have one question , Yeah . because for the intelligent controller , <vocalsound> you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , Yeah . but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? Y <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe . or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . Yeah , sure . For example , if you cannot find your uh <vocalsound> controller , you can just uh <vocalsound> just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . I One and <disfmarker> Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah but how how is <disfmarker> how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? Broken arm ? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? Yeah . Yeah , but the <disfmarker> so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , <vocalsound> Yeah but <vocalsound> Yeah we can <disfmarker> Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . yeah . Even you h you have the controller , I can <vocalsound> I can say channel three , No . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> it's <gap> <vocalsound> so it's c come to channel three , No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . I don't have to <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's advantage . Yeah . And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to Yeah , but one other question . manual controllers , eh . How how much will it cost ? No , more expensive maybe . How much ? No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . So I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . Well y y you have also the language problem , No when you <disfmarker> Mm-mm . 'Cause it it have to be universal , so . Yeah . I agree with uh <disfmarker> The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . Yeah . Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international <vocalsound> Yeah . Suppose we're <disfmarker> we want to sell it in France . Yeah . The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , the key , the key um the key of our <disfmarker> the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's <disfmarker> And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to <disfmarker> Oh really ? Yeah , but then w Seems to be quite complex . Yeah , I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just <disfmarker> the microphone is embedded in the controller . Yeah , A microphone maybe . Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . Okay you <disfmarker> so you can build a kind of black box Devic and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . But you would still have the buttons . Or is it <disfmarker> do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? think it <disfmarker> we should give the uh flexibility to the user Okay , yeah . Yeah , You can see <disfmarker> they can switch form one modality to another . Mm . Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky . Yeah . With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use that's quite inter quite attractive . And maybe it will be quite <disfmarker> But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so <disfmarker> although y y Yeah , yeah . commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . Yeah . Mm . To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . Yeah , turning <vocalsound> <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . Simple ones ? Yeah , simple ones for <disfmarker> If if <disfmarker> I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . More features , I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ? Yeah , but uh we want so but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . True . That's <disfmarker> the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our <disfmarker> from other products . Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . Yeah <disfmarker>
Later ? <vocalsound> So you think <gap> case . Something spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Someth no wood . <vocalsound> No wood but <disfmarker> Plastic ? Pla Maybe you <disfmarker> I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . Yeah , maybe the base . It depends on the design we want , so . It's it's natural . But still y Th The feeling is natural , and i so maybe we can stay with wood . And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , <vocalsound> Spongy <vocalsound> 'Kay . okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . Okay , yeah , yeah . I dunno . Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? Yeah thi this is this would be like um Pla plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh S
Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh <vocalsound> uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh <vocalsound> just as vital to this project Mm . um <vocalsound> I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um <disfmarker> designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . <vocalsound> What's uh <disfmarker> the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh <vocalsound> everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say .
everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh <disfmarker> uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you <disfmarker> you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew . Oh my name's Andrew I'm a <disfmarker> I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to <gap> like <disfmarker> and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . Right <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm Kendra Kendra . and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um <vocalsound> I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m Yep , I'm just open to being creative . <vocalsound> Uh I'm Katie , Yep , good . I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh <disfmarker>
so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . Everybody says what they <gap> what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have
And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board
the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh <vocalsound> let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um <disfmarker> In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I <disfmarker> everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . Um , badger . <vocalsound> Mm and why ? 'cause of the the white streaks in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um probably a duck Kendra . Right , okay . Uh 's horses , no particular reason why <vocalsound> . I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think homo sapien because of their <disfmarker> their uh overall ability to uh uh <disfmarker>
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . <vocalsound> It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , tha that's um <disfmarker> Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh <disfmarker> we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,
we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um <vocalsound> would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . Well I think <disfmarker> I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that <disfmarker> it's easy to <gap> if you can switch back and forth instead of having to <vocalsound> press a bunch of different buttons No . and <disfmarker> so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know . Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's important that you should be able to <disfmarker> when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it <disfmarker> the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . Yeah . Yeah . Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and <gap> T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't Mm . like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . Mm . like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like <disfmarker> Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . Um what so wh what's in in <disfmarker> what particular style features are you thinking about ? <vocalsound> Um . Something that looks looks <disfmarker> doesn't look like remote control . <vocalsound> d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , <vocalsound> people won't see it as a remote control um and uh <disfmarker> Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a <disfmarker> of remote controls ? I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things Mm . and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , <vocalsound> so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better . I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses Well from the mouse idea you could , <gap> remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want <gap> <disfmarker> could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . Yes , I mean <vocalsound> the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh Mm . I suppose . fi find the button buttons easily . Easily , yeah yeah . But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them <disfmarker> be kind of down so you could feel them Yeah , that's uh <disfmarker> must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh <disfmarker> certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh <disfmarker> I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there well this <disfmarker> you c you could either market it as the point of view <disfmarker> we could have the two <disfmarker> we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable Mm . and like you just <disfmarker> it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , Mm-hmm . therefore they want it so <disfmarker> make it practical at the same time . I think it's <disfmarker> this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's <gap> <disfmarker> God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel <vocalsound> it just <disfmarker> it needs to be very effective , very <disfmarker> always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I <disfmarker> 'cause I think it needs to <gap> it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . Yeah . and um colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ? <vocalsound> Well , most <disfmarker> I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , <vocalsound> <gap> . so maybe we should go with something different or be able to <disfmarker> I was just thinking of um <vocalsound> what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um <disfmarker> what are they called ? Like the face-plates Yeah . that you change so we could have maybe <disfmarker> I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety Uh-huh . so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , Okay that's uh <disfmarker> Again I don't think that's ever been done before , <vocalsound> you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh <vocalsound> maybe thinking of that , it's <disfmarker> considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing <disfmarker> like a second campaign to market new facials for your <disfmarker> to your <disfmarker> might go a bit astray Mm . since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one Yeah . Well you could come up with like novelty ones , I think <disfmarker>
Right , okay Yeah true . I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh <disfmarker> meeting is uh <disfmarker> Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed .
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros tha that's um <disfmarker> Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh <disfmarker> we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh <disfmarker> we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,
so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . <vocalsound> It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product ,
Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The <disfmarker> what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . Yeah . Um then It does look very cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . <vocalsound> Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S
Yeah . Yes . Presentation . so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> It's a bit um phallic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <vocalsound> Dual use , perfect . <gap> . Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . Cool . Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be <gap> and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Yeah . It l does look like the <gap> curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . Yeah . Mm-hmm , very good . So I think it <disfmarker> And it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
Yeah . The volume is is scrolling . On the side , It's on the side . Yeah you just do it like this . mm-hmm . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . Oh okay , <gap> . but then once you flip it open , <vocalsound> okay , there there you have the screen Yeah . and and you have the mm <vocalsound> spinning wheel with options to choose . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . <vocalsound> Uh no , we we'd not put <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A mute button . Yeah . Well , <gap> we'll have this on the screen , on the display . so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . Y or you could have it <disfmarker> so you <disfmarker> on the wheel if you <disfmarker> On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . Well , but the but the mute <disfmarker> yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? But if you hold it in , Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? Mm . if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? Okay , yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . You can't really see it in the interface . <gap> no . ? Oh that's just bad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? <vocalsound> Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . Sorry , sorry . So now we we have the <disfmarker> okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . Mm-hmm . And we have the user interface o in here Wow . and uh <vocalsound> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um And it's <disfmarker> the whole thing's made of rubber , is that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . <vocalsound> I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <vocalsound> on the cover we just have the very basic things . <vocalsound> Huh . Mm-hmm . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three <disfmarker> there would be numbers in in the <disfmarker> on the actual one . Yeah . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . <vocalsound> Six seven eight nine . I like that . Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . Yeah . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and <disfmarker> like the previous one and the next one . Uh-huh . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . So where's the volume ?
Yep . Um , cool . G_ technologically innovative . <vocalsound> Anyway it ha yeah , Technologi <gap> well <disfmarker> it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is <disfmarker> yeah , it's kind of new . Yeah . Yeah , but I mean you don't <disfmarker> All of the components have been used in other things before . But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . But do <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> . What do you reckon , five , six ? Yeah , what do you all think ? Six . Six ? That's it , they can take it with them . Put fashion in electronics . <vocalsound> Absolutely . <vocalsound> So , we give it seven , Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . and we write <disfmarker> Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer <disfmarker> prepare the evaluation of the new design . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like <disfmarker> so these are what they are . Oh <disfmarker> So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Mm dots , never mind . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . <vocalsound> Could <disfmarker> oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . Ah , okay . If you take a note of them , I can I can take note uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? I would think yes , yeah . Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , I think it does . so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <vocalsound> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Alright . Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Yeah . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . Mm . So maybe we need to put <disfmarker> that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Um <disfmarker> What do you what do you all think ? Six . Or maybe six , Mm . One more thing is that i Okay . It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , They <disfmarker> it won't be heavy . Oops . I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . Yeah well yeah , Yeah , but we <disfmarker> which makes it kind of really big , yeah . but it's it's a bit long . so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? No , we're gonna put it like <disfmarker> we've got we have a locator . th there's the locator dot . There's a locator . Cool , Mm that you stick on T_V_ . so that means you need a <disfmarker> that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , Mm . doesn't it ? To make it beep . Yeah well w So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? <vocalsound> Yeah . If <vocalsound> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's <disfmarker> I th I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . I'd say six , 'cause the <disfmarker> I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , Yeah . but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . Intuitive . Might be <disfmarker> so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . But it <disfmarker> and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Yeah . Yeah . So , should we maybe say f a five So l okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . Yep . But otherwise it's superb . So , should we give it a six ? Six . Six ? Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design <disfmarker> well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , Yeah . <gap> . but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , Yeah . Yeah , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . Yeah . And moreover it it has um <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . Yeah . it's varied . Yeah . Six ? Okay , so we give that a six , yeah .
Yeah . <gap> . What do you reckon , five , six ? Yeah , what do you all think ? Six . Six ? <vocalsound> There we go . So I think we've done very well , I think that's a <gap> . <vocalsound> What's the assessment ? Yeah . So , we need the average here , so we got <disfmarker> The average is about six and something . <vocalsound> Yeah , one . Two three four <disfmarker> Seven eight . about six point five . <vocalsound> Six point five , yeah . Close enough . Okay , that's pretty good , I think . <vocalsound> So maybe we need to put <disfmarker> that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Um <disfmarker> What do you what do you all think ? Six . Or maybe six , Mm . One more thing is that i Okay . It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , They <disfmarker> it won't be heavy . Oops . I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . Yeah well yeah , Yeah , but we <disfmarker> which makes it kind of really big , yeah . but it's it's a bit long . So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? <vocalsound> Yeah . If <vocalsound> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's <disfmarker> I th I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . I'd say six , 'cause the <disfmarker> I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , Yeah . but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . Intuitive . Might be <disfmarker> so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . But it <disfmarker> and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Yeah . Yeah . So , should we maybe say f a five So l Yep . But otherwise it's superb . So , should we give it a six ? Six . Six ? Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design <disfmarker> well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , Yeah . <gap> . but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , Yeah . Yeah , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . Yeah . And moreover it it has um <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . Yeah . it's varied . Yeah . Six ? Okay , so we give that a six , yeah .
Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . One simple battery . Mm . No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . Advanced , yeah . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . Yep . Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . Yeah , yes . Case material we said rubber . Rubber . Yep . I don't know what special colour means . Mm anything uh I think which is not more <gap> . <vocalsound> I think something coloured , yeah , probably . Yeah . Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . Rub rubber comes coloured , Yeah . it's <disfmarker> I would <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , Yeah , you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . We we're definitely going to have to <disfmarker> We have pushbuttons , so we've got pushbutton , and then we've scro we have scroll wheel as well . Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . Yeah . And we have L_C_ display and <disfmarker> yeah . And button supplements . Um <disfmarker> No . No ? we're not using any of that . Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel <disfmarker> But the the spinning wheel's not there . We've got more than one pushbutton though , <vocalsound> I don't know if that's one <disfmarker> That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . Yeah . That seems unlikely . Push what uh Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . Twelve point five . whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we <disfmarker> We have to count all of them , or <disfmarker> yeah . Mm I don't think so , no . I don't think that makes sense . No . No it says what what is the kind of interface , No . if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel <disfmarker> so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , Yeah . so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . <vocalsound> Wh wh what's our criteria ? This sample sensor <gap> . Our budget's twelve point five . Uh okay .
Our budget's twelve point five . Uh okay . Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . Yeah , so that has implications though for the <gap> . Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . <gap> when you say <disfmarker> when you press one it says one or it says hello . Yeah . For the locator . But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? Yeah . Mm <vocalsound> and the locator also goes away . We can afford to get rid of it . What else does it need ? Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . Yeah , A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um <disfmarker> yeah . Uh-huh . Okay , yeah . Right , so we need one fifty off . Um <disfmarker> See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause <disfmarker> Take it down to just a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We could do <disfmarker> So tha that <vocalsound> mean that we cannot press <disfmarker> Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? If <vocalsound> in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . But that's <disfmarker> well you would just have to to spin it down <gap> . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . Mm-hmm . So that's point three . No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . But I mean <vocalsound> we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . Oh so so the the this is <disfmarker> Mm . The scroll wheel is on the side . <gap> . So <vocalsound> S so we're point three over . We're point three over at the moment . It's nothing n Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but <disfmarker> I have <disfmarker> Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up <disfmarker> for up and down . Yeah . There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve <gap> , couldn't we ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . Yeah , but <gap> <disfmarker> Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? No . No , I don't think so . Not really , no . Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . Mm . We <disfmarker> Yeah . instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . We just got rid of a gimmick that was never <gap> anyway , Yeah . Alright then . <vocalsound> But we lose the locator . <vocalsound> Well <gap> we're going to have a beeping thing . Really ? We're gonna have a beep . So instead of speaker , <gap> . But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , Yeah . so we still have the locate . Yeah . But it can be yellow as well . It <disfmarker> It can come in the same colour as the the case . 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh <gap> .
<vocalsound> Um we need <disfmarker> we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . <vocalsound> I think it mm <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> . Ideas ? Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Mm-hmm . Not quite sure what about . Well it's it's it's pretty new , Yeah . <vocalsound> So , had we known <disfmarker> If we'd had that sheet at the beginning <gap> should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . <vocalsound> Yeah , that or not , yeah . But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . Yeah , mm . I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . Mm-hmm . Patent patent patent . Mm . Banana remote . I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out . <vocalsound> Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . And the pens . <vocalsound> Uh I like the pens . <vocalsound> We like the pens . <vocalsound> I want one . New ideas found . Yep . Okay . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the <disfmarker> I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static
Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . I have no stake in it . Yeah , definitely . Yeah . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . You have to say that , <vocalsound> Better than that than the banana . And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . I think it worked quite well . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? To express them mm mm Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , no . so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . Yeah . Were there any <disfmarker> was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , Mm-hmm . sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . <vocalsound> I thought that was good though , Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little <disfmarker> But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , Mm . I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . Yeah . <vocalsound>
Smells very sweet . Mm . Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . Was there a questionnaire already sent ? I don't know if it's already sent or not . No , it hasn't been . Um presumably I have to <disfmarker> Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? I don't see why you can't stay here , really . Okay , so the other way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . So , costs are within budget , Yes . <vocalsound> well within budget , including a little <disfmarker> what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project . Yes . You've got the scores . And it's fabulous . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in the project documents <gap> . It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any <disfmarker> was there anything that you found difficult , Um I think we're still well within our time . Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . Yeah . mm . Yeah . Yes . So I would say that's the end of that meeting . <vocalsound> Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . Thank you , team .
Smells very sweet . Mm . Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . Was there a questionnaire already sent ? I don't know if it's already sent or not .
So now we we have the <disfmarker> okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . Mm-hmm . and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <vocalsound>
And we have the user interface o in here Wow . and uh <vocalsound> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um
Yeah . The volume is is scrolling . On the side , Huh . Mm-hmm . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three <disfmarker> there would be numbers in in the <disfmarker> on the actual one . I like that . Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it So where's the volume ?
Yeah . <gap> . Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . Cool .
<vocalsound> Yeah . One simple battery . Mm . No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . Advanced , yeah .
Yep . Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . Yeah , yes . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
And it's <disfmarker> the whole thing's made of rubber , is that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .
<vocalsound> Well <gap> we're going to have a beeping thing . Really ? We're gonna have a beep . So instead of speaker , <gap> . What else does it need ? Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . Yeah ,
Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Yeah . One more thing is that i Okay . It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , They <disfmarker> Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? I would think yes , yeah . Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , I think it does . so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <vocalsound> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Alright .
<vocalsound> Yeah . If <vocalsound> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's <disfmarker> I th I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . I'd say six , 'cause the <disfmarker> I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , Yeah . but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . Intuitive . Might be <disfmarker> so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . But it <disfmarker> and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . Intuitive . I really like the way you have it ,
Right , so we need one fifty off . Um <disfmarker> See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause <disfmarker> Take it down to just a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We could do <disfmarker> Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . Mm-hmm . S so we're point three over . We're point three over at the moment . It's nothing n Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but <disfmarker> I have <disfmarker> Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up <disfmarker> for up and down . Yeah . so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . <vocalsound> Wh wh what's our criteria ? Our budget's twelve point five . Uh okay . Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . Yeah ,
Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Mm-hmm . So , had we known <disfmarker> If we'd had that sheet at the beginning <gap> should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . <vocalsound> Yeah , that or not , yeah .
Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use <gap> novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one .
Um uh the con today is the concep today . I'll just <disfmarker> This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um <disfmarker> Sorry about this . <gap> . And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , Alright . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh . The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . Uh but later on <gap> we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um <vocalsound> if you go on to the next slide . Uh <disfmarker> this is what I found we can use . Uh three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? Mm . Yeah , I don't think it would . Um . And solar cells , I dunno about that . <gap> yeah . Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls . Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? Um . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> And these are three different types of <disfmarker> or two different types <disfmarker> three different types of shapes you can have . Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . Um <vocalsound> the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , <vocalsound> Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? Um . <vocalsound> T yeah . Um I don't exactly <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Double curved . It probably means <disfmarker> this is probably double curved . Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . I guess . Or not necessarily . Alright . Um which obviously <disfmarker> it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is uh a nice material . <vocalsound> Uh Mm . and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um <vocalsound> if you want the buttons to be <disfmarker> oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But <vocalsound> you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . Um , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Okay , that's good point . We have to look into the costs of those . So , sorry . Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . Okay . And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . So <gap> . So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? Um <disfmarker> I think we can do it if <vocalsound> uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? <gap> . Mm . Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail . Okay . I also have a preference for rubber . Okay ,
So it's not <vocalsound> I'm not really excessively concerned about that . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right <vocalsound> left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you Can I just jump in slightly there ? Mm-hmm . That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . Yes , absolutely . so that the um the L_C_ <vocalsound> the L_C_D_ and the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The joystick would be in the right place . And <vocalsound> also this is <gap> a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the <vocalsound> the um you know the whole thing you know <vocalsound> it should have sort of organic feel to it Mm . that it should be , you know , soft to touch and Assuming the hand <vocalsound> the hand to be in about sort of this position , um <gap> hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a <disfmarker> it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . so it can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um <disfmarker> So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it <vocalsound> actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some <vocalsound> some fair iv <gap> fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you <disfmarker> on your <gap> computer just so that you could um pr <vocalsound> program it at a rather <vocalsound> in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you <disfmarker> i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a <vocalsound> ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , <vocalsound> and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if <vocalsound> so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um <vocalsound> v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , as it goes . <vocalsound> Next slide please . Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . <vocalsound> They want it to be <disfmarker> that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . Technology technical <disfmarker> technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important . <vocalsound> And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important <disfmarker> I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it <disfmarker> I is if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , <gap> prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . <vocalsound> The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . How that relates to a remote control I don't know . <vocalsound> But I I see <vocalsound> I come on to that in the next in the next slide . Spongy . I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then <disfmarker> can I skip the rest ? <vocalsound> Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . Okay . Okay , <vocalsound> Forgot to say that . so kinda spongy material . So um so Okay . my personal opinion ? <vocalsound> Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um <vocalsound> I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler So I think cool is the key . <vocalsound> Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year . So , things change all the time , every year you know
I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean <vocalsound> mi <vocalsound> rather cool . I don't know how serious you were there , but we <disfmarker> if we take some of the ideas <gap> why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? Yeah . Sure , yeah . Okay . It's an <disfmarker> certainly a different colour from your average um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Make it harder to lose , as well . Yeah . Sure . Was there anything in your research <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , <vocalsound> it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> monkey <vocalsound> . y <vocalsound> you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . I th uh I mean if it <disfmarker> oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . Mm-hmm . the um for <vocalsound> f for uh <disfmarker> I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic <vocalsound> will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . Mm-hmm . that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um <vocalsound> different actual units that have been produced . I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are <vocalsound> are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um The U_S_B_ for which ? For the remote control . The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming Oh right , okay . but for Different . programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . Okay , yeah . I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . Mm . do <disfmarker> I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? Yeah . <gap> they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . Mm-hmm . I <gap> having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . so . Mm-hmm . So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um . Mm . Yeah . I was <vocalsound> like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . Okay . so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um . Mm-hmm . Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um <gap> boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be <disfmarker> Yeah , actually <gap> if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau <vocalsound> <gap> it's Yeah . So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um <disfmarker> Looks like we <gap> going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say <vocalsound> depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . Yeah , I mean <vocalsound> I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? So <disfmarker> I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? That would be a worry of mine .
I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um looking from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh <vocalsound> progress . Um <disfmarker>
I would say yeah . International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can <disfmarker> t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . <vocalsound> I I think we'd be <disfmarker>
the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um <disfmarker> So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery ,
the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um <disfmarker> Looks like we <gap> going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . say something like um lithium ion battery ,
Looks like we <gap> going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say <vocalsound> depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .
I don't know how serious you were there , but we <disfmarker> if we take some of the ideas <gap> why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? Yeah . Sure , yeah . Okay .
oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . Mm-hmm . The U_S_B_ for which ? For the remote control . The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming the um for <vocalsound> f for uh <disfmarker> I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic <vocalsound> will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . Mm-hmm . Oh right , okay . but for programming it <vocalsound> actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some <vocalsound> some fair iv <gap> fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you <disfmarker> on your <gap> computer just so that you could um pr <vocalsound> program it at a rather <vocalsound> in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you <disfmarker> i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a <vocalsound> ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , Different . I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . Mm . programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .

Okay , yeah .
so . Mm-hmm . So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um . Mm . Yeah . I was <vocalsound> like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . Okay .
<vocalsound> Uh , what we going to do . Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . So , um no presentation for me . Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . <vocalsound> s <vocalsound> sorry . <vocalsound> Uh evaluation crit criteria . Uh , in combination with the finance I um <vocalsound> uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file <vocalsound> Hmm . which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . Hmm . Interesting . we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh <disfmarker> yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . Oh . Yeah . And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the <disfmarker> all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start .
Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh <disfmarker> you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 'S l <disfmarker> it's like an uh Easter egg . Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . Yeah . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . Mm-hmm . I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . Shall I give a short introduction and then uh <disfmarker> Yeah , well sure . J_ and J_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . <vocalsound> Idea maybe uh is better . <vocalsound> Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . <vocalsound> So we began uh working out a concept . Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the <gap> more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top <disfmarker> oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh <disfmarker> there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh <disfmarker> with these two . Hmm . And so when you put it on the table , it will just <gap> lay down . It won't <vocalsound> uh roll around or stuff . Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . the panel just uh of course goes like this . Yeah . But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . Okay . And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh <gap> put some electronics uh that would <disfmarker> you can make a more thinner uh design , Yeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this <disfmarker> maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some <disfmarker> have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . Okay .
Yeah , I can imagine that . <vocalsound> And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually , Yeah . so it d It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , Or blue or whatever . but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , Hmm . they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh <disfmarker> Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . Well , um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . So , there must be some cheap standard cover , Hmm . Mm . that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . Oui okay . uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . Okay . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , The other way around , you mean . <gap> Oh yeah . and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . Uh-huh . So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , maybe <disfmarker> yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . Okay , yeah . An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . Yeah . Well yeah , a colour of <disfmarker> a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . <vocalsound> Yes . Nah . Yeah . And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . Not not too uh <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . Yeah . Or blue or <disfmarker> Not too , but w a little , Ah . Mm-hmm .
Yeah , yeah , not too flashy . Yeah . The remote control is made of soft material . <vocalsound> Um , Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . kinda soft , but but not this <gap> . Yeah , but not too soft we have decided . Three ? Yeah . Three , yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah , easy to use , Easy to use . One . <vocalsound> very afford . Well , <vocalsound> I don yeah , it is kind of <disfmarker> Top easy to use ? It's it's not the most easy to use <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> it can be easier . It could <disfmarker> yeah . Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . But then you're l function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button But <disfmarker> It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . <vocalsound> Two ? Yeah , m mine too . Okay , two . Yeah , two . We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So <disfmarker> We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . These are the m regular remotes . Yeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying . Okay , eleven . <vocalsound> The remote control is innovative . Yeah . You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? <vocalsound> The remote control has m remova <vocalsound> removable <gap> from Multilux . <vocalsound> No . The remote control , i it has speech recognition . False . Yes , False . it <disfmarker> This is used with speech recognition , this . The remote control has built-in games ? Yes . <vocalsound> But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh <disfmarker> it's not an entire game . Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . Yeah , they are built in . Not down . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> <vocalsound> And the last , paren <vocalsound> parental advisory function . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You really like the parental advisory . <vocalsound> the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . That's interesting . So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . Okay , All the mo yeah , are between one and two . all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . <vocalsound> So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . Opening a Word document now . One <disfmarker> oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something . We have to uh be consensive about about things . So , it has to be a group uh group decision . so we gon we gonna evaluate the Uh <disfmarker> We're going to vote . We <disfmarker> Okay , just saw . Okay , one . The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . Yeah . Seven ? Most true ? Why ? Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . Mm . uh three or <disfmarker> yeah . I've <disfmarker> Yeah , two or three , because it's not just <disfmarker> But also for <disfmarker> yeah , okay . Uh , second . The remote control is beautiful . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> acco according to us , it's one ? Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I I think <disfmarker> We have a wonderful <disfmarker> Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . Yeah . Well , it's also fancy then . Three . Uh , the remote control looks fancy . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . One ? Of course . We have a perfect remote . Good . Four . The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . Yes . Yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm the User Interface uh Expert . <vocalsound> Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? Um , uh no . No teletext buttons . Teletext is in the menu . You you've different menu . And volume ? yeah . Volume is true . True . Big and clear ? <vocalsound> Yeah , the they are big and clear . <gap> . Yeah yeah , big and clear . but <disfmarker> So , I wouldn't give it a seven . I would give it a more a five or a six . No . <vocalsound> Okay . Volume . The remote control is easy to be found . Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Fruity . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it has these <disfmarker> all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . <vocalsound> Yeah . but <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? <vocalsound> It'll make a difference . We have the better re <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . Four ? Well , then uh then I'll go for four . Four ? <vocalsound> Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . Yeah , okay , you're right . so I'll I'll go for four . Ah , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . Wha Exa I think that that's what it's about . If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? If it <disfmarker> if this lying on your couch , you're you're <disfmarker> you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . Yeah , yeah . But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , that's stupid . <vocalsound> Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh <disfmarker> Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . True . <vocalsound> Um I would call uh <disfmarker> choose two , <vocalsound> 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not <gap> .
That's zero . Me , too . Battery , yes . One . Yes . Well , we're only four Euro over budget . no . Okay . One , yeah . Okay . Kinetic , one . Kinetic , one ? No . No ? Advanced chip . No . Thingy . <vocalsound> no ? Okay . <vocalsound> So it's only uh once double-curved . Yeah . Eight . Okay . We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . <vocalsound> Just go on . Then we'll see uh <disfmarker> we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . Okay . And zero . Titanium , no ? <vocalsound> Special uh <disfmarker> is the special colour ? Special colour ? Mm . I don't think so . No , this is a standard colour . No . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> Yes , this is a special colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour . <vocalsound> Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand . <vocalsound> That's an add-on . Yeah , one . That's another article to sell . Hmm ? Mm . Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . <vocalsound> sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So <disfmarker> Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components .
Yeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But <disfmarker> I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . Well , we're only four Euro over budget . no . Okay . Yeah , well let's assume it is . Yeah , it is . Oh . So , um what's the thing we can change ? No . No . Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . Yeah . Uh , can I uh I say something ? Mm , single-curves . Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . Yeah . Just cut off the kine The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , yeah . because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . Yeah . Okay , sure . Yeah , I think so . Well , now you can shake your remote <gap> control . <vocalsound> No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . <vocalsound> Kinetic . Not freaks , the envi What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station Yeah . Yeah ? Who <disfmarker> <vocalsound> rechargeable batteries in it and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . Yeah , and not really <gap> . because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , <vocalsound> and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Yeah . Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . So um <disfmarker> Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just <disfmarker> oh <disfmarker> Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . It's just <disfmarker> yeah well , the single-curve that <disfmarker> No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or <disfmarker> Oh , okay , okay . And then w yeah , and then we could have it , Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> but uh <disfmarker> it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . <gap> <disfmarker> but what else uh do we have to cut out ? We going to cut <disfmarker> No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . No , tho uh that that can be done . Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign <disfmarker> Yeah . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . No , no no . So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done . R if you uh promote a kinetic um <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an <disfmarker> a normal remote control . what is the uh <disfmarker> If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . More . Yeah . fun function more like <disfmarker> Worth , does it have added worth ? Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Okay , Yeah , it was good . I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Yeah , that's true . but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I notice it too . But <disfmarker> I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the About me . <vocalsound> Try to learn from your mistake . <vocalsound> And we will never do it again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk <disfmarker> No , it <disfmarker> you did better . Yeah , more more consensus . Yeah . Uh , teamwork ? Well , maybe that's uh only <disfmarker> Yeah well , it's for us , because uh <disfmarker> Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . Yeah . Yeah So , it is a little bit <disfmarker> and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . <vocalsound> Yeah . No <disfmarker> But , really teamwork were you two uh <disfmarker> Two guys . <vocalsound> Stupid stupid pen , but uh <disfmarker> No hard feelings . Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but us <disfmarker> Yeah . D uh just write your name right now . Try to write your name , You can be <disfmarker> you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . um the the the the digital pen . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh <disfmarker> It's it's not real real use for me . No , it doesn't have that much added value to the <disfmarker> Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . Yeah . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . M yeah . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , <vocalsound> no , it isn't . With uh <disfmarker> And the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large . Okay . New ideas ? M Abo What kind of new ideas ? Um <disfmarker> Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Go on . <vocalsound> I'm just uh <disfmarker> New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so . I don't know what what I mean . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> No . and it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and <disfmarker> Yeah . You had expected it to to be uh more more uh <disfmarker> More user-friendly . Yeah . just you can write in the way you normally write . Hmm ? No . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . And that's a very bad concept . There's no text option . Yeah . And writing text <disfmarker> uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some <disfmarker> Yeah , Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . Yeah . but insert image isn't available ? <vocalsound> 'Cause then you could <disfmarker> Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . Yeah , that that can be done already . Oh , okay . But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh <disfmarker> So you can <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . there . So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , But <disfmarker> and it's it's very <disfmarker> <gap> . it costs a lot of time to uh To use , yeah . to use . We <vocalsound> Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . Okay , um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh <disfmarker> was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? Um <disfmarker> Hmm . I I didn't think so . That <disfmarker> there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . Yeah . It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . Well , I th I think you two , <vocalsound> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . Yeah . I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design <disfmarker> we could have more <disfmarker> we had more room for creativity than than you two . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . Okay . Uh how about the leadership ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . Well , I th I think you two , <vocalsound> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . Yeah . Well , maybe that's uh only <disfmarker> Yeah well , it's for us , because uh <disfmarker> Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . Yeah . Yeah So , it is a little bit <disfmarker> and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design <disfmarker> we could have more <disfmarker> we had more room for creativity than than you two . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . No <disfmarker> But , really teamwork were you two uh <disfmarker> Two guys .
<vocalsound> Okay , Yeah , it was good . I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Yeah , that's true . but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I notice it too . But <disfmarker> I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the About me . <vocalsound> Try to learn from your mistake . <vocalsound> And we will never do it again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk <disfmarker> No , it <disfmarker> you did better . Yeah , more more consensus . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Stupid stupid pen , but uh <disfmarker> No hard feelings . Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but us <disfmarker> Yeah . D uh just write your name right now . Try to write your name , You can be <disfmarker> you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . um the the the the digital pen . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh <disfmarker> It's it's not real real use for me . No , it doesn't have that much added value to the <disfmarker> Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . Yeah . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . M yeah . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , <vocalsound>
You can ask your personal <disfmarker> Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh <disfmarker> Yeah , the end conclusion . But uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think . Yeah , touch-screen I've mentioned . Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think . Okay . Okay , this n yeah . Yeah , okay , well I gonna redesign uh something now . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Because I think it will <disfmarker> Oh , five minutes from <disfmarker> to finish meeting . Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first . Save it . Oh , that's cool , Tim . Uh , Finish meeting now . Well , I'm I'm why are only the first five SMARTboard files I'm going to finish my end report . saved ? Yeah . But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , because uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh <disfmarker> What is an end report ? Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , Yeah . Uh , that must be made , but I don't know , <vocalsound> here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is <disfmarker> Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read . Oh . You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . Okay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah ? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board . Yeah , sure . But it's not uh fully finished yet . Five minutes for finishing . Um , this is about the functional design , the things <disfmarker> yeah yeah . when I said it , I remember I had it here . It's a read-only version . Yeah , but you can save it u the <disfmarker> under another name . Oh , okay . Marketing Expert , okay . Um about the three functions where <disfmarker> uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> No , you have to put <disfmarker> uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second <disfmarker> Oka okay , okay , I really <vocalsound> didn't knew that . Oh nay , a volume changing , second . So , this one's first . S switch , yes . You go there and you go there . Uh , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , Yeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . Yeah , because <disfmarker> yeah . Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . Single-curves . <vocalsound> Uh , the buttons It's not double . Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ? Not double anymore . No , okay . Nay but that <disfmarker> this is what um <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Was initial , the plan . The initial plan . Yeah . Yeah . And the the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh <disfmarker> One small thing uh , the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? I don't think so , eh ? Ah , it's very cheap .
Yeah , okay , that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think . why are only the first five SMARTboard files I'm going to finish my end report . saved ?
Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . Yeah . Or blue or <disfmarker> Yes . Nah . Yeah . And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . Not not too uh <disfmarker> yeah . uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . Okay . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , The other way around , you mean . <gap> Oh yeah . and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . Uh-huh .
Uh , can I uh I say something ? Mm , single-curves . Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . So um <disfmarker>
Yeah . Just cut off the kine The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , yeah . because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . Yeah . Okay , sure .
Well , we're only four Euro over budget . no . Okay .
Yeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But <disfmarker> I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . Yeah , well let's assume it is . Yeah , it is . Oh . So , um what's the thing we can change ? No . No . Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . Yeah . Uh , can I uh I say something ? Mm , single-curves . Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . Yeah . Just cut off the kine The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , yeah . because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . Yeah . Okay , sure . Yeah , I think so . Well , now you can shake your remote <gap> control . <vocalsound> No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . <vocalsound> Kinetic . Not freaks , the envi What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station Yeah . Yeah ? Who <disfmarker> <vocalsound> rechargeable batteries in it and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . Yeah , and not really <gap> . because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , <vocalsound> and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Yeah . Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . So um <disfmarker> Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just <disfmarker> oh <disfmarker> Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . It's just <disfmarker> yeah well , the single-curve that <disfmarker> No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or <disfmarker> Oh , okay , okay . And then w yeah , and then we could have it , Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> but uh <disfmarker> it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . <gap> <disfmarker> but what else uh do we have to cut out ? We going to cut <disfmarker> No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . No , tho uh that that can be done . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . R if you uh promote a kinetic um <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an <disfmarker> a normal remote control . what is the uh <disfmarker> If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . More . Yeah . fun function more like <disfmarker> Worth , does it have added worth ? Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . Yeah .
Well , maybe that's uh only <disfmarker> Yeah well , it's for us , because uh <disfmarker> Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . Yeah . Yeah So , it is a little bit <disfmarker> and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . <vocalsound> Yeah . No <disfmarker> But , really teamwork were you two uh <disfmarker> Two guys . Hmm . I I didn't think so . That <disfmarker> there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . Yeah . It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . Well , I th I think you two , <vocalsound> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . Yeah . I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design <disfmarker> we could have more <disfmarker> we had more room for creativity than than you two . Yeah .
<vocalsound> Stupid stupid pen , but uh <disfmarker> No hard feelings . Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but us <disfmarker> Yeah . D uh just write your name right now . Try to write your name , You can be <disfmarker> you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . um the the the the digital pen . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh <disfmarker> It's it's not real real use for me . No , it doesn't have that much added value to the <disfmarker> Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . Yeah . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . M yeah . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , <vocalsound>
Right . I just wanna <disfmarker> 'cause basically I can't re I've <disfmarker> really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna <disfmarker> rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that <vocalsound> wanted to know your names again . Okay . Mm 'kay . Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I am your Project Manager , <vocalsound> and , uh yeah , I'm just here to <gap> sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this <disfmarker> for the purposes of this meeting <disfmarker> what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , Then we're gonna <vocalsound> work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll <gap> sort of conclude <gap> anything else comes up at the end of it . How long is the meeting ? This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . Okay . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . <vocalsound> No problem . <vocalsound> Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker>
I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . but never mind . So um <vocalsound> the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well <disfmarker> okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called Uh and then <vocalsound> um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . Fine . <vocalsound> Or suggestions ? Is a battery like the only way of <disfmarker> Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s No I meant like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bicycle power . No 'cause like cha 'cause <disfmarker> always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . <vocalsound> maybe <vocalsound> , I dunno , solar charged ? <vocalsound> I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but <disfmarker> Yeah , One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . How far away is your television ? Yeah . It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not <disfmarker> doesn't have to go that far , Uh <disfmarker> Well , the thing is uh you you don't <disfmarker> does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the <disfmarker> put the telephone down , and go into the other room . <vocalsound> That's true . Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that How about Bluetooth ? <gap> but <disfmarker> I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> you're gonna use it . Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you <gap> you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . Mm <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Oh well ,
And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , And I <disfmarker> judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units <gap> stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or <disfmarker> No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another <disfmarker> <gap> exists <gap> like you like you said in in mobile phones . I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that <gap> a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? Um <disfmarker> I would say it's <disfmarker> If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , these , I think , we can <disfmarker> so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . Yeah . So I'm doing the user interface design . Mm-hmm . Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . <gap> we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but <disfmarker> Mm yeah . Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that <vocalsound> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . uh that's one possibility .
Yeah . Great . Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <vocalsound> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . Mm <vocalsound> .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so yeah um <vocalsound> I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um <vocalsound> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find <vocalsound> , so I don't know whether maybe <disfmarker> and also we asked them whether they wanted <vocalsound> <disfmarker> whether they'd be interested in um <vocalsound> voice activating . <vocalsound> so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <vocalsound> No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . They they don't . It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and <disfmarker> Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent <gap> say no , so <disfmarker> For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not <gap> sort of <disfmarker> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , Yeah , that would be my guess as well . These guys are growing up . <vocalsound> What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . Yeah . I mean , okay , there's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Voice activation might not be the best . I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . Uh . Um also with um with buttons , <vocalsound> a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . Yeah . I think we can do some really <disfmarker> in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . Yeah . Come on . Right . Okay . <gap> . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave <disfmarker> Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um <vocalsound> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like <disfmarker> like the way they operate
You want to have friends , don't you ? <vocalsound> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as <gap> <disfmarker> yeah , okay . maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . <vocalsound> Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit <disfmarker> Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white <disfmarker> with yellow borders . Okay . maybe you can come up with a few <disfmarker> with a couple of different ideas ? Mm . Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col This is slog <gap> but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , Yeah . so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . So we have to have it one colour . Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . Mm . Not necessarily even if i it just has to <disfmarker> ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products Well you could <disfmarker> It's got to <disfmarker> so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere Yeah . Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . <vocalsound> But a in <disfmarker> there's no
we just want <disfmarker> need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . Mm . I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . Yeah .
I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um .
And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , Yeah . so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . So we have to have it one colour . Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . Mm . Not necessarily even if i it just has to <disfmarker> ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products Well you could <disfmarker> but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <vocalsound> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . Mm <vocalsound> .
I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . Uh . <vocalsound> Voice activation might not be the best .
there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . Okay , fantastic . I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . Yeah . I think we can do some really <disfmarker> in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . Yeah .
Uh <disfmarker> Well , the thing is uh you you don't <disfmarker> does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the <disfmarker> put the telephone down , and go into the other room . <vocalsound> I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> you're gonna use it . Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you <gap> you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . Mm <vocalsound> . you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . How far away is your television ? Yeah . It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not <disfmarker> doesn't have to go that far ,
Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the <disfmarker> put the telephone down , and go into the other room . <vocalsound> That's true . Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .

I mean obviously another <disfmarker> <gap> exists <gap> like you like you said in in mobile phones .
And it's easy to find <vocalsound> , so I don't know whether maybe <disfmarker> and also we asked them whether they wanted <vocalsound> <disfmarker> whether they'd be interested in um <vocalsound> voice activating . <vocalsound> so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <vocalsound> No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . They they don't . It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and <disfmarker> Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent <gap> say no , so <disfmarker> For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not <gap> sort of <disfmarker> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , Yeah , that would be my guess as well . These guys are growing up . <vocalsound> What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . Yeah . I mean , okay , there's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Voice activation might not be the best . I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . Uh .
Yeah . Great . Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . Okay , fantastic . I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . Yeah . I think we can do some really <disfmarker> in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . Yeah .
You want to have friends , don't you ? <vocalsound> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as <gap> <disfmarker> yeah , okay . maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . <vocalsound> Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit <disfmarker> Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white <disfmarker> with yellow borders . Okay . maybe you can come up with a few <disfmarker> with a couple of different ideas ? Mm . Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col This is slog <gap> but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , Yeah . so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . So we have to have it one colour . Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . Mm . Not necessarily even if i it just has to <disfmarker> ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products Well you could <disfmarker> It's got to <disfmarker> so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere Yeah .
