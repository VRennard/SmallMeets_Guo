Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station.
Weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow.
Three push buttons.
For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use.
For pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one.
For pricing reasons the remote will have a single, not double curve.
For pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced, single curve instead of double, rechargable batteries instead of solar cells, and eliminate the turbo button.
This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.
It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.
The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.
When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.
The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.
Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.
The prototype was more than 40% over budget.
The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements.

The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users.
He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages.
The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television.
The remote will be used with a recharging stand.
The group decided not to include a lighting adaptation system.
The participants disagreed on how to easily move through channels using the design of the User Interface Designer, which included very few buttons.
There was no resolution on whether or not to allow users to use the remote to access the internet through their television, as opposed to including teletext capabilities.
